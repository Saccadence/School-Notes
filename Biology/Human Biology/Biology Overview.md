Cumulative Review:

1\. Differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells:

\- Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus, while eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus.

\- Prokaryotic cells are typically smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells.

\- Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have various membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, etc.

\- Prokaryotic cells have circular DNA, while eukaryotic cells have linear DNA.

\- Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells divide by mitosis or meiosis.

 

2\. Functions of mitochondria, ribosomes, and nucleus:

\- Mitochondria: They are responsible for cellular respiration, generating energy in the form of ATP.

\- Ribosomes: They are involved in protein synthesis, translating mRNA into proteins.

\- Nucleus: It houses the cell's DNA and is responsible for regulating gene expression and controlling cell activities.

 

3\. Characteristics of the four tissue types:

\- Muscle tissue: It is responsible for contraction and movement. Types include skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle.

\- Nervous tissue: It transmits and processes electrical signals. It comprises neurons and supporting cells.

\- Connective tissue: It provides support and connects different tissues and organs. Examples include bone, blood, cartilage, and adipose tissue.

\- Epithelial tissue: It covers body surfaces, lines organs, and forms glands. It functions in protection, secretion, absorption, and filtration.

 

4\. Chemical bonds:

\- Covalent bonds: Formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.

\- Ionic bonds: Formed by the transfer of electrons between atoms, resulting in charged ions that attract each other.

\- Hydrogen bonds: Weak bonds between a hydrogen atom and an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen).

\- Van der Waals interactions: Weak attractions between temporary dipoles in molecules.

 

5\. Digestion locations for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids:

\- Carbohydrates: Digestion starts in the mouth (salivary amylase), continues in the small intestine (pancreatic amylase), and is completed by enzymes on the surface of intestinal cells (disaccharidases).

\- Proteins: Digestion starts in the stomach (pepsin) and continues in the small intestine (proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin).

\- Lipids: Digestion primarily occurs in the small intestine, where bile salts emulsify fats, and pancreatic lipases break them down into fatty acids and glycerol.

 

6\. End products of digestion:

\- Carbohydrates: Monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose).

\- Proteins: Amino acids.

\- Lipids: Fatty acids and glycerol.

 

7\. Cellular respiration and oxygen:

\- The electron transport chain, the final step of cellular respiration, requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor to generate ATP.

 

8\. ATP production in cellular respiration:

\- The majority of ATP is produced during the electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation), specifically through the process of chemiosmosis.

 

9\. ATP production without oxygen:

\- Without oxygen, cellular respiration cannot proceed efficiently. Instead, a limited amount of ATP can be generated through glycolysis alone, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP molecules.

 

10\. Differences between mitosis and meiosis:

\- Mitosis: It is a process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is involved in growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction.

\- Meiosis: It is a process of cell division that occurs in specialized cells called germ cells, leading to the formation of gametes (sperm and eggs). It involves two divisions and results in four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

 

11\. Importance of cell reproduction:

\- Cell reproduction is vital for growth, development, and the replacement of damaged or worn-out cells in the body. It allows for the maintenance and perpetuation of life.

 

12\. Effects of mutations in somatic cells vs. in gametes:

\- Mutations in somatic cells are not passed on to offspring and primarily affect the individual in which they occur.

\- Mutations in gametes (sperm or eggs) can be inherited by offspring and potentially impact future generations.

 

13\. DNA coding for traits and the role of mutations:

\- DNA contains the genetic information that codes for traits. Genes are specific segments of DNA that provide instructions for the production of proteins, which ultimately determine traits.

\- Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can alter the instructions encoded in genes, potentially leading to variations in traits. Some mutations may be harmful, beneficial, or have no significant effect.

 

14\. Dominant and recessive inheritance:

\- Dominant inheritance: When a dominant allele is present, it masks the effect of the recessive allele. Only individuals with two copies of the recessive allele express the recessive trait.

\- Recessive inheritance: A recessive trait is expressed only when an individual has two copies of the recessive allele.

 

15\. Natural selection in humans:

\- Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over generations due to differential reproductive success.

\- In humans, natural selection can act on traits that affect survival, reproduction, and adaptation to the environment, leading to evolutionary changes over time.

 

16\. Homeostasis components:

\- Variable: The aspect or condition being regulated.

\- Sensor: Detects changes in the variable and sends information to the control center.

\- Control center: Receives input from the sensor, compares it to a set point, and initiates a response if needed.

\- Effector: Responds to signals from the control center and produces a physiological response to adjust the variable.

 

17\. Plasma membrane structure and function:

\- The plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins.

\- Its functions include regulating the passage of substances into and out of the cell, maintaining cell shape, facilitating cell communication, and protecting the cell from the external environment.

 

18\. Selective permeability of the plasma membrane:

\- The plasma membrane selectively allows the passage of certain substances while restricting the movement of others, based on factors such as size, charge, and solubility.

 

19\. Similarities and differences between active and passive transport:

\- Passive transport: It does not require energy and relies on the concentration gradient to move substances across the membrane (e.g., diffusion, osmosis).

\- Active transport: It requires energy (usually in the form of ATP) to move substances against the concentration gradient, from areas of lower concentration to higher concentration.

 

20\. Membrane transport in cardiovascular and respiratory systems:

\- In the cardiovascular system, active transport is involved in the transport of ions across cell membranes in the heart and blood vessels, contributing to electrical signals and maintaining proper fluid balance.

\- In the respiratory system, passive transport mechanisms like diffusion and osmosis occur in the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the alveoli and capillaries.

 

21\. Graded potentials, action potentials, and synaptic transmission:

\- Graded potentials: Local changes in membrane potential that vary in magnitude, often resulting from sensory input or synaptic signals.

\- Action potentials: Rapid, brief, and all-or-nothing electrical signals that propagate along the axon of a neuron, enabling long-distance communication.

\- Synaptic transmission: The process by which information is transmitted from one neuron to another across a synapse, involving the release, diffusion, and binding of neurotransmitters.

 

22\. Organization of the nervous system:

\- Central Nervous System (CNS): It includes the brain and spinal cord, responsible for processing and integrating information.

\- Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): It comprises nerves and ganglia outside the CNS, transmitting signals between the CNS and the rest of the body. It is divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.

\- Somatic Nervous System: Controls voluntary movements and transmits sensory information.

\- Autonomic Nervous System: Regulates involuntary processes and is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.

 

23\. Fight or flight vs. rest and digest:

\- Fight or flight response: It is an automatic physiological response to a perceived threat or stress, preparing the body for action by increasing heart rate, releasing stress hormones, and redirecting blood flow to essential organs.

\- Rest and digest response: It is a state of relaxation and digestion that occurs when the body is in a safe and resting state. It promotes digestion, conservation of energy, and maintenance of homeostasis.

 

24\. Nervous system control over the cardiovascular and respiratory systems:

\- The autonomic nervous system regulates the cardiovascular system by adjusting heart rate, blood pressure, and blood vessel diameter.

\- The respiratory system is regulated by the brainstem, which controls breathing rate and depth in response to the body's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

 

25\. Sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction:

\- Muscle contraction occurs when myosin filaments slide past actin filaments, resulting in the shortening of muscle fibers.

\- Calcium ions released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum trigger the interaction between actin and myosin, allowing myosin heads to bind to actin and exert force.

 

26\. Characteristics of cardiac muscle in relation to the cardiovascular system:

\- Cardiac muscle is striated, involuntary muscle found in the heart.

\- It contracts rhythmically and continuously to pump blood throughout the body.

\- Cardiac muscle cells are interconnected by intercalated discs, allowing coordinated contraction and electrical signaling.

 

 

 

Cardiovascular Review:

1\. A. Functions of the cardiovascular system:

\- Transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other substances to tissues and organs.

\- Removing waste products and carbon dioxide from tissues.

\- Regulating body temperature and pH balance.

\- Providing immune system components for defense against pathogens.

\- Maintaining fluid balance within the body.

 

B. Differences between hormonal signaling and nerve signaling:

\- Hormonal signaling: Involves the release of hormones into the bloodstream by endocrine glands. Hormones travel throughout the body and bind to specific receptors on target cells to initiate a response. It is slower but can have widespread effects.

\- Nerve signaling: Involves the transmission of electrical signals (action potentials) along specialized cells called neurons. Nerve signals are fast and precise, allowing for rapid communication and coordination in the body.

 

C. Main structures of the circulatory system:

\- Heart: Pumping organ responsible for circulating blood.

\- Blood vessels: Tubes that carry blood throughout the body. They include arteries (carry blood away from the heart), veins (carry blood toward the heart), and capillaries (connect arteries and veins, allowing exchange of substances with tissues).

 

D. Basic function of the heart:

\- The heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body's tissues through systemic circulation and receives deoxygenated blood from the body and sends it to the lungs for oxygenation through pulmonary circulation.

 

E. Pulmonary circulation:

\- Pulmonary circulation refers to the flow of blood between the heart and the lungs. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right side of the heart and is pumped to the lungs for oxygenation.

 

F. Systemic circulation:

\- Systemic circulation refers to the flow of oxygenated blood from the heart to the body's tissues. Oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, enters the systemic circulation, and supplies oxygen and nutrients to the body's organs and tissues.

 

2\. A. Structures of the human heart/circulatory system:

\- Right atrium: Receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava.

\- Left atrium: Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins.

\- Right ventricle: Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.

\- Left ventricle: Pumps oxygenated blood to the body through the aorta.

\- Superior vena cava: Brings deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the right atrium.

\- Inferior vena cava: Brings deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the right atrium.

\- Aorta: Carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the body.

\- Pulmonary artery: Carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.

\- Pulmonary veins: Carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium.

\- Semi-lunar valves: Valves located at the exit of the heart's ventricles (pulmonary valve and aortic valve), preventing backflow of blood.

 

B. Diagram: Please provide a diagram to locate the structures accurately.

 

C. Path of blood from the left ventricle:

Left ventricle → Aortic valve → Aorta → Systemic circulation → Body tissues → Superior/inferior vena cava → Right atrium → Right ventricle → Pulmonary valve → Pulmonary artery → Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium.

 

D. Oxygenated blood: Pulmonary veins, Aorta.

Deoxygenated blood: Superior/inferior vena cava, Pulmonary artery.

 

3\. A. Blood vessels:

\- Arteries: Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body's tissues. They have thick, elastic walls to withstand high pressure.

\- Veins: Carry deoxygenated blood toward the heart from the body's tissues. They have thinner walls and contain valves to prevent backflow.

\- Capillaries: Microscopic vessels that connect arteries and veins. They have thin walls, allowing for the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between blood and surrounding tissues.

 

B. Main function of capillaries:

\- Capillaries facilitate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the bloodstream and surrounding tissues.

 

C. Capillary structure and exchange:

\- Capillaries have thin walls, consisting of a single layer of endothelial cells. This thin structure allows for efficient diffusion of substances between the blood and surrounding tissues.

\- Materials move into and out of the capillaries due to concentration gradients and pressure differences. Oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the capillaries into tissues, while carbon dioxide and waste products diffuse from tissues into the capillaries.

 

D. Skeletal muscle pump, respiratory pump, and valves in veins:

\- Skeletal muscle pump: Contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding veins helps propel blood forward and prevent backflow.

\- Respiratory pump: During inhalation, the decrease in thoracic pressure and the expansion of the chest cavity help draw blood towards the heart, enhancing venous return.

\- Valves in veins: Valves within veins ensure one-way flow of blood, preventing backflow and aiding in the return of blood to the heart.

 

4\. A. Cardiac cycle:

\- The cardiac cycle refers to the complete sequence of events that occur in the heart during one heartbeat, including both systole and diastole.

 

B. Duration of the cardiac cycle:

\- The duration of the cardiac cycle varies but is typically around 0.8 seconds at rest.

 

C. Diastole and systole:

\- Diastole: The relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart chambers fill with blood.

\- Systole: The contraction phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart chambers pump blood out.

 

D. Heart sounds (lub-dub):

\- The "lub" sound is caused by the closure of the atrioventricular (A-V) valves (mitral and tricuspid valves) during ventricular contraction (systole).

\- The "dub" sound is caused by the closure of the semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic valves) during ventricular relaxation (diastole).

 

E. Possible cause for a heart murmur:

\- A heart murmur can be caused by abnormal blood flow through the heart valves, such as leakage (regurgitation) or narrowing (stenosis) of the valves.

 

5\. A. Blood pressure:

\- Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels.

 

B. Two numbers in blood pressure measurement:

\- The two numbers represent systolic pressure over diastolic pressure (e.g., 120/80 mmHg).

 

C. Systolic and diastolic:

\- Systolic pressure: The higher number represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts (during ventricular systole).

\- Diastolic pressure: The lower number represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart relaxes (during ventricular diastole).

 

D. Blood vessels with the greatest blood "pressure":

\- Arteries have the highest blood pressure due to their proximity to the heart and their ability to withstand the forceful contraction of the heart

 

.

 

E. Blood pressure lower in other vessels:

\- Blood pressure decreases as blood flows through smaller arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, as these vessels have a larger total cross-sectional area, allowing for reduced velocity and increased exchange of substances with tissues.

 

6\. A. Baroreceptors and communication with the cardiovascular control center:

\- Baroreceptors are specialized sensory receptors that detect changes in blood pressure. They communicate this information to the cardiovascular control center.

 

B. Location of the cardiovascular control center:

\- The cardiovascular control center is located in the medulla oblongata, a part of the brainstem.

 

C. Activation of parasympathetic neurons and blood pressure:

\- Parasympathetic activation leads to a decrease in heart rate and vasodilation, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure.

 

D. Activation of sympathetic neurons and blood pressure:

\- Sympathetic activation leads to an increase in heart rate and vasoconstriction, resulting in an increase in blood pressure.

 

E. Increasing heart rate and blood pressure:

\- Increasing heart rate leads to an increase in cardiac output, which, in turn, increases blood pressure.

 

F. Decreasing the diameter of blood vessels and blood pressure:

\- Decreasing the diameter of blood vessels (vasoconstriction) increases peripheral resistance, which raises blood pressure.

 

G. Decreasing heart rate and blood pressure:

\- Decreasing heart rate leads to a decrease in cardiac output, which, in turn, decreases blood pressure.

 

H. Importance of maintaining blood pressure at a "just right" level:

\- Maintaining blood pressure within an appropriate range is critical for ensuring adequate perfusion of organs and tissues while preventing damage to blood vessels and organs due to excessive pressure or insufficient blood flow.

 

7\. A. Contribution of hypertension to atherosclerosis:

\- Hypertension (high blood pressure) increases the strain on blood vessel walls, promoting the development of atherosclerosis (build-up of plaque in arteries).

 

B. Health problems associated with atherosclerosis:

\- Atherosclerosis can lead to coronary artery disease, heart attacks, strokes, peripheral artery disease, and other cardiovascular complications.

 

C. Problems caused by embolism:

\- Embolism occurs when a blood clot or foreign material (embolus) blocks a blood vessel. It can lead to heart problems (if it blocks coronary arteries), brain problems (if it blocks cerebral arteries), or lung problems (if it blocks pulmonary arteries).

 

D. Ways to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases:

\- Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, avoiding tobacco use, and controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

\- Regular medical check-ups and adherence to prescribed medications or treatments.

\- Managing underlying conditions such as diabetes or obesity.

\- Avoiding or minimizing exposure to risk factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and unhealthy dietary choices.

 

 

 

Respiratory Review:

1\. A. We need to breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide because oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration, the process by which cells produce energy. Oxygen is used by cells to break down glucose and produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of cells. During this process, carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product, and it needs to be removed from the body.

 

B. The four components of respiration are:

\- Ventilation: The process of breathing in and out, which involves the movement of air into and out of the lungs.

\- External respiration: The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the bloodstream.

\- Transport of gases: The transportation of oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and the transportation of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.

\- Internal respiration: The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the bloodstream and the body's tissues.

 

2\. A. Major structures of the respiratory system and their functions:

\- Nose/Mouth: Entry points for air into the respiratory system.

\- Pharynx: Passageway for air and food.

\- Larynx: Contains the vocal cords and produces sound.

\- Trachea: The windpipe that connects the larynx to the bronchi.

\- Bronchi: Branches of the trachea that lead to the lungs.

\- Lungs: Main organs of respiration where gas exchange occurs.

\- Alveoli: Tiny air sacs in the lungs where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is removed.

 

B. Air conducting and gas exchange structures:

\- Air conducting: Nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi.

\- Gas exchange: Alveoli.

 

C. Locating structures on a diagram and following the path:

\- The path of air: Nose/Mouth → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea → Bronchi → Lungs → Alveoli.

 

D. Production of sound by the larynx:

\- The larynx contains vocal cords that vibrate when air passes over them, producing sound. The tension and position of the vocal cords, controlled by muscles, determine the pitch and volume of the sound produced.

 

3\. A. Inhalation/Inspiration:

\- During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, while the intercostal muscles between the ribs contract, causing the ribcage to expand. These actions increase the volume of the chest cavity, lowering the pressure inside the lungs. As a result, air flows into the lungs from the higher atmospheric pressure.

 

B. Exhalation/Expiration:

\- During normal exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. This causes the chest cavity to decrease in volume, increasing the pressure inside the lungs. As a result, air is expelled from the lungs.

 

C. Structures that expand during air intake:

\- The diaphragm and intercostal muscles expand to allow the chest cavity to expand during air intake.

 

4\. A. Partial pressure:

\- Partial pressure refers to the pressure exerted by a specific gas in a mixture of gases. It represents the concentration of that gas.

 

\- Partial pressure of O2 (PO2) is high in the lungs and arterial blood. It is low in the tissues.

\- Partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) is high in the tissues. It is low in the lungs and arterial blood.

 

B. Direction of CO2 and O2 movement during external respiration:

\- Oxygen (O2) moves from the alveoli into the bloodstream (pulmonary capillaries) due

 

to a concentration gradient. Carbon dioxide (CO2) moves from the bloodstream (pulmonary capillaries) into the alveoli.

 

C. Direction of CO2 and O2 movement during internal respiration:

\- Oxygen (O2) moves from the bloodstream (systemic capillaries) into the tissues due to a concentration gradient. Carbon dioxide (CO2) moves from the tissues into the bloodstream (systemic capillaries).

 

D. Partial pressures of O2 and CO2 in arterial blood:

\- Partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood (PaO2) is typically around 75-100 mmHg.

\- Partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (PaCO2) is typically around 35-45 mmHg.

 

E. Partial pressures of O2 and CO2 in venous blood:

\- Partial pressure of O2 in venous blood (PvO2) is typically around 35-40 mmHg.

\- Partial pressure of CO2 in venous blood (PvCO2) is typically around 40-45 mmHg.

 

5\. A. Oxygen transport through the body:

\- Oxygen is mainly carried through the body by binding to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells.

 

B. Driving force for oxygen movement into tissues:

\- The driving force for oxygen movement into tissues is the concentration gradient, with higher oxygen levels in the blood compared to the tissues.

 

C. Ways carbon dioxide is carried from the tissues in the blood:

\- Carbon dioxide is transported in three ways: dissolved in plasma, bound to hemoglobin, and as bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) in the plasma.

 

D. Driving force for carbon dioxide movement from tissues to blood:

\- The driving force for carbon dioxide movement from tissues to the blood is the concentration gradient, with higher carbon dioxide levels in the tissues compared to the blood.

 

E. Driving force for CO2 movement from blood into alveoli:

\- The driving force for carbon dioxide movement from the blood into the alveoli is the partial pressure gradient, with higher levels of carbon dioxide in the blood compared to the alveoli.

 

6\. A. Central and peripheral chemoreceptors and their effects on breathing rate and depth:

\- Central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla oblongata and respond to changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide and pH in the cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid bodies and aortic bodies and primarily respond to changes in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood.

\- An increase in carbon dioxide or a decrease in pH (acidic conditions) stimulates the chemoreceptors, leading to an increase in breathing rate and depth.

 

B. Gas responsible for changes in breathing rate or depth:

\- Changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) are primarily responsible for changes in breathing rate and depth.

 

7\. A. Respiratory diseases discussed in class and their possible causes:

\- Examples of respiratory diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, bronchitis, and lung cancer.

\- Possible causes can include genetic factors, exposure to environmental pollutants (such as smoking or air pollution), infections, allergies, and other underlying medical conditions.

 

B. Effects of smoking on the respiratory system:

\- Smoking can lead to various respiratory problems, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer, and increased risk of respiratory infections. It damages the cilia in the respiratory tract, causing mucus buildup and impaired clearance, and it also irritates and inflames the airways, leading to reduced lung function and tissue damage.

 

 

 

Immune Review:

1\. a. The overall function of the body's immune system is to protect the body from harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, and to eliminate them when they enter the body.

 

b\. The three lines of defense in increasing level of sophistication are:

\- First line of defense: Physical and chemical barriers, such as the skin, mucous membranes, and secretions, which act as the body's initial barrier to prevent pathogen entry.

\- Second line of defense: Non-specific immune responses, including inflammation, phagocytosis, and the complement system, which provide immediate protection against a wide range of pathogens.

\- Third line of defense: Adaptive or acquired immune responses involving specialized immune cells called lymphocytes (B cells and T cells), which provide targeted and long-lasting protection against specific pathogens.

 

2\. a. Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.

 

b\. Categories of pathogens include bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae causing pneumonia), viruses (e.g., Influenza virus causing the flu), fungi (e.g., Candida albicans causing yeast infections), and parasites (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum causing malaria).

 

3\. a. The three criteria used to assess the health risk of pathogens are:

\- Pathogenicity: The ability of a pathogen to cause disease.

\- Virulence: The degree of pathogenicity, indicating the severity of the disease caused by a pathogen.

\- Transmission: The method by which a pathogen spreads from one individual to another.

 

b\. Comparing the health risk of the cold virus and the Ebola virus:

\- The cold virus (rhinovirus) has low pathogenicity and virulence. It spreads through respiratory droplets, which are easily transmitted. Although it causes mild symptoms, it is highly prevalent but rarely life-threatening.

\- The Ebola virus has high pathogenicity and virulence. It spreads through direct contact with infected body fluids, which limits its transmission. It causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever, but its outbreak is relatively rare.

 

4\. a. Functions and locations of lymphatic structures:

\- Lymphatic vessels: Transport lymph (a clear fluid containing immune cells and waste products) throughout the body.

\- Lymph nodes: Filter lymph and contain immune cells that help fight infections.

\- Spleen: Filters blood, removes old or damaged red blood cells, and helps in immune responses.

\- Thymus gland: Site of T cell maturation during childhood.

\- Tonsils/adenoids: Lymphoid tissues in the throat that help trap and eliminate pathogens.

\- Red bone marrow: Produces blood cells, including immune cells.

 

5\. 1st line of defense:

a\. The skin is a good physical/chemical barrier to pathogens because it acts as a waterproof and protective barrier. It has a tough outer layer and contains antimicrobial substances that can kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens.

b\. Areas of the body that are more susceptible to infectious agents getting inside include mucous membranes (e.g., respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract) and areas with thinner or damaged skin.

c\. Other methods used to prevent entry into the body include mucous secretions, coughing and sneezing reflexes, tears, saliva, and the flushing action of urine.

d\. Resident bacteria are normal, harmless bacteria that colonize certain areas of the body, such as the skin and intestines. They protect us from infection by occupying space, competing with harmful bacteria for nutrients, and producing substances that inhibit the growth of pathogens.

 

6\.

 

2nd line of defense:

a\. Phagocytosis is the process by which specialized cells called phagocytes engulf and destroy microbes. Phagocytes recognize and attach to pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome, which fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome. The phagolysosome then digests and eliminates the pathogen.

b\. The inflammatory response helps block the spread of infectious agents. It is initiated by the release of histamines, which cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. This leads to increased blood flow, redness, and swelling at the site of infection. Phagocytes are attracted to the site and engulf and destroy pathogens.

c\. When the skin surface is breached, redness (caused by increased blood flow), warmth (caused by increased metabolic activity), swelling (due to increased vascular permeability and fluid accumulation), and pain (due to tissue damage and inflammation) may occur.

d\. The complement system is activated by various pathways, leading to the formation of membrane attack complexes that destroy pathogens, opsonization of pathogens for phagocytosis, and release of chemical mediators that promote inflammation and attract immune cells.

 

7\. Other non-specific (2nd line of defense) mechanisms:

\- Natural killer (NK) cells: Specialized immune cells that recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells.

\- Interferon: Proteins released by cells in response to viral infections, which help limit the spread of the virus to other cells.

\- Fever: An increase in body temperature triggered by the release of pyrogens, which helps inhibit the growth of certain pathogens and enhances immune responses.

 

8\. a. The third line of defense, also known as adaptive or acquired immunity, works to protect us from infection by mounting specific immune responses against particular pathogens. It involves the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of specific antibodies or cell-mediated immune responses.

 

b\. The second line of defense recognizes pathogens using non-specific receptors that can recognize general patterns associated with pathogens, such as specific molecular structures present on microbes. In contrast, the third line of defense recognizes pathogens using highly specific receptors called antigen receptors, which are present on lymphocytes and can recognize unique antigens associated with specific pathogens.

 

c\. The third line of defense takes 7-10 days to launch an efficient immune response because it involves the activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation of specific lymphocytes that can recognize the antigen presented by the pathogen. In contrast, the second line of defense is available immediately and provides immediate but non-specific protection. The third line of defense is used when the second line of defense is insufficient to eliminate the pathogen or when encountering a new or recurring pathogen.

 

d\. Antigen: An antigen is a molecule or a part of a molecule that can be recognized by the immune system. Antigens can be proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, or nucleic acids.

 

Lymphocytes recognize antigens through their antigen receptors. Each lymphocyte has a unique antigen receptor on its surface. In a population of lymphocytes, there is a diverse repertoire of antigen receptors, allowing recognition of a wide range of antigens. Each individual lymphocyte, however, has receptors specific to a particular antigen.

 

9\. a. Lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that play a central role in the immune response. Their general function is to recognize and respond to specific antigens, leading to the elimination of pathogens and the development of immunological memory.

 

b\. Lymphocytes are produced by mitosis in the bone marrow and the thymus gland.

 

c\. The two basic types of lymphocytes are B cells and T cells.

 

d\. Mature and functioning

 

lymphocytes can be found in lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, adenoids, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) present in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts.

 

10\. a. B cells are a type of lymphocyte involved in antibody-mediated or humoral immune responses. They mature in the bone marrow and are responsible for producing antibodies and generating immunological memory.

 

b\. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by B cells in response to specific antigens. They can bind to antigens, neutralize pathogens, promote phagocytosis, activate the complement system, and facilitate the destruction of pathogens.

 

c\. Clones are identical copies of B cells that are derived from a single B cell. Plasma cells are fully differentiated B cells that secrete large amounts of antibodies into the bloodstream. Memory B cells are long-lived B cells that remain in the body and can mount a rapid and robust immune response upon re-exposure to the same antigen.

 

11\. When a foreign pathogen enters the body:

\- B cells with antigen receptors specific to the pathogen recognize and bind to the antigen on the pathogen's surface.

\- The activated B cells undergo clonal expansion, producing a large number of identical clones.

\- Some clones differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete antibodies specific to the antigen.

\- Antibodies bind to the pathogen, marking it for destruction or neutralizing its activity.

\- Memory B cells are formed and remain in the body, providing long-term immunity. Opsonization and neutralization help get rid of pathogens by promoting phagocytosis and blocking the pathogens' ability to infect cells, respectively.

 

12\. a. T cells are a type of lymphocyte involved in cell-mediated immune responses. They are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which present antigens to T cells. T cells mature in the thymus gland.

 

b\. Cell-mediated immunity is an immune response mediated by T cells, primarily targeting intracellular pathogens, cancer cells, and foreign tissues. It involves the activation and proliferation of T cells and the release of cytokines to coordinate the immune response.

 

c\. Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) help coordinate and regulate immune responses by secreting cytokines that activate other immune cells. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) directly kill infected or cancerous cells. Memory T cells are long-lived T cells that provide long-term immunity and enable a faster and stronger immune response upon re-exposure to the same antigen.

 

13\. a. Mature but inactivated lymphocytes can be found in lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils, waiting for antigen presentation and activation.

 

b\. The number of mature, inactivated lymphocytes varies among individuals and depends on factors such as previous antigen exposure, immune history, and current health status.

 

14\. a. Immunological memory refers to the ability of the immune system to remember a previous encounter with a specific pathogen. It allows for a quicker and more effective immune response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. During the first exposure, the immune response takes time to develop. However, subsequent exposures result in a faster and stronger immune response due to the presence of memory cells.

 

b\. Immunological memory is applied during immunization by introducing weakened or inactivated forms of pathogens or their components into the body. This stimulates the immune system to produce a specific immune response, including the production of memory cells. If the person is later exposed to the actual pathogen, the immune response is rapid and robust, leading to protection against the disease.

 

c\. Vaccines can be generated using various approaches,

 

including inactivated or attenuated pathogens, subunit vaccines containing specific pathogen components, toxoid vaccines derived from bacterial toxins, and nucleic acid-based vaccines, such as mRNA vaccines.

 

15\. a. Allergic reactions are generated when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances called allergens. During the first exposure to an allergen, the immune system recognizes it as foreign and produces specific antibodies called IgE antibodies. These antibodies bind to mast cells and basophils.

 

During the second exposure to the same allergen, the allergen binds to the IgE antibodies already attached to mast cells and basophils. This triggers the release of histamine and other inflammatory molecules, leading to allergic symptoms.

 

With repeated exposures to the allergen, the immune response becomes more intense, resulting in more severe allergic reactions.

 

b\. Anti-histamine drugs are a good treatment for allergic reactions because they block the action of histamine, reducing the allergic symptoms caused by histamine release.
