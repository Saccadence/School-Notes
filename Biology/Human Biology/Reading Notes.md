    - Palm Oil Plantations, Agricultural Expansion, and Livestock Operations can affect environments and ecosystems as well

 

1.1 - The Characteristics of Life

- Everything living and non-living are all composed of the same set of 100 different chemical elements

  - Only a few present in any abundance in living organisms

- Living things can create certain molecules that non-living things cannot

  - Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids are all found in living things

- Living things require energy and raw materials

  - Metabolism - Physical and chemical processes involved in transforming energy and molecules to sustain life

- Living things are composed of cell(s)

  - Smallest unit that exhibits all the characteristics of life

    - Can only originate from other existing cells

- Living things maintain homeostasis

  - Internal environment compatible with the range of chemical and physical conditions needed for life

  - Cannot prove or disprove existence, or importance to us, of things that fall outside the realm of the natural world

- The importance of making informed choices

 

Chapter 3.1 - Cells are Classified According to Their Internal Organization

- Plasma Membrane

  - Outer membrane that encloses material inside the cell

    - Mostly water

    - Ions, enzymes, and other structures the cell requires to survive

- Eukaryotes

Chapter 3.2 - Cell Structure Reflects Cell Function

- Eukaryotic cells are largely the same in structure between organisms for their given tasks

  - Function over form

  - Nerve cells between species are more alike than nerve vs liver in same species

- Cells remain small (exception of some things like eggs of some species)

  - Basic rules:

    - Total metabolic activities of a cell are proportional to its volume of cytoplasm

    - All raw materials, energy, and waste must cross the plasma membrane to enter or leave the cell

    - As cells get larger their volume increases more than surface area, 8x to 4x respectively

  - The larger it gets, the more likely its growth and metabolism will be limited by its ability to import and export material (logistics issue)

- Microvilli

  - Microscopic projections of the plasma membrane

    - Increase surface area relative to volume

    - Common in cells that transport substances into and out of the body

      - Digestive tract and the tubules of the kidneys

- Ways to see cells

  - Three main microscopes:

    - Light Microscope (LM)

      - Uses light to illuminate a sample viewed through a magnifying lens

        - Up to 1000x

      - Only thing that can be used to view living samples

    - Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)

      - Electrons hit (slice) a thin slice of an object

        - Creates a two-dimensional image

        - Up to 100,000x

      - Can reveal structural details inside a cell

    - Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

      - Scan the surface of an object with electrons

        - Three-dimensional image of outer surface

        - Up to 100,000x

  - The TEM and SEM are very large and expensive

    - Substantial training needed for proper preparation of a cell and processing of the image

      - Processing can take several hours or days

        - Images are only black and white, usually digitally colored in posts

- Nucleus

  - Information center

    - Contains DNA

      - Genetic material

      - Controls all of the activities of the cell

  - Nuclear Membrane

    - Double-layered membrane

      - What contains the DNA in the nucleus

    - Bridged by Nuclear Pores

      - Too small for DNA

      - Allow passage for RNA and certain small proteins

  - Nucleolus

    - Dense

    - Components of Ribosomes are synthesized

      - Pass through Nuclear Pores to be assembled into ribosomes in the cytoplasm

- Ribosomes

  - Small structures of RNA and certain proteins that are either floating freely in the cytosol or are attached to the Endoplasmic Reticulum

  - Responsible for making specific proteins

    - Assemble Amino Acids in the correct sequence according to the RNA template

  - Proteins then packaged into saclike structures called Vesicles

- Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

  - Work with attached ribosomes

  - Synthesizes most of the chemical compounds made by the cell

    - Get refined and packaged after by the Golgi Apparatus

  - Rough ER

    - Region studded with Ribosomes

    - Synthesis of proteins

      - Most get released into fluid-filled portion of ER before entering Smooth ER

  - Smooth ER

    - Region without Ribosomes

    - Synthesizes macromolecules other than protein

      - Some notable ones are Lipids and some Hormones

      - Enzymes embedded in the inner surface facilitate the chemical reactions necessary for synthesis

    - Packages the proteins and lipids to go to the Golgi Apparatus

      - Newly synthesized proteins and lipids collect in outermost layers

      - Small portions of the fluid-filled space are pinched off forming Vesicles

        - Migrate to Golgi Apparatus, fuse with membrane, then release contents

- Golgi Apparatus

  - Refining, processing, and shipping center

    - Contain enzymes for refining into final form

  - Interconnected fluid-filled spaces surrounded by membrane

    - Form Vesicles for final products

- Vesicles

  - Membrane-bound storage and shipping containers

  - Found in various areas but only contain on product per

    - Proteins in the membrane "label" the contents

      - If not immediately needed, they sit in the cytoplasm until they are

  - Specific Types of Vesicles:

    - Secretory Vesicles

      - Contain products destined for export from the cell

      - Migrate to plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell

        - Secretory products mostly come from Golgi Apparatus, therefore most of these originate from there

    - Endocytic Vesicles

      - Enclose bacteria and raw materials from the extracellular environment and bring them into the cell

        - Process called Endocytosis

          - Section of plasma membrane folds inward to form a small sac which then pinches closed to form a vesicle

    - Peroxisomes and Lysosomes

      - Contain enzymes so powerful that they must be kept within the vesicle to avoid damaging the rest of the cell

      - Both are produced by the Golgi Apparatus

      - Functions:

        - Peroxisomes

          - Break down toxic wastes (such as alcohol and hydrogen peroxide)

            - Degrade them into harmless waste and then excrete it

        - Lysosomes

          - Fuse with Endocytic Vesicles containing a bacterium and other large objects

            - Digest the bacterium/large object and residual waste is excreted

          - Also do house-keeping tasks

            - Dissolving and removing damaged mitochondria and other cellular debris

          - Become Residual Bodies when digestion is complete

            - Can be stored in cell, but usually eliminated from the cell

- Mitochondria

  - Produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)

    - Use food and other energy sources

      - Break down the chemical bonds to release the energy from them

    - Transported to the Cytosol

      - ATP is available as a quick energy source for the cell

    - Can provide energy for synthesizing macromolecules, transporting substances across the cell membrane, and facilitating movement

  - Long term fuel exists in the form of Fat and Glycogen

    - Sit around, freely, waiting to them to be delivered to a mitochondrion

    - Fat can also exist as lipids

      - Most fat cells are large droplets of stored lipids

    - Glycogen (granules) can be used to produce ATP more quickly than fat

      - Commonly found in Muscle cells

 

3.4 - Cells Have Structures for Support and Movement

- Cytoskeleton

  - Made of loosely structured network of fibers called Microtubules and Microfilaments

    - Both are composed of protein

    - Microtubules are tiny hollow tubes, Microfilaments are thin solid fibers

      - Attach to each other and other proteins in the plasma membrane, called Glycoproteins, which usually have Carbohydrate Group components

  - Form a framework for the soft plasma membrane

  - Supports and anchors the other structure within the cell

- Cilia and Flagella

  - Hair-like

    - Cilia are around 2-10 microns long (0.0001 cm)

    - Flagella are around 200 microns long (0.02 cm)

      - Only found on sperm cells

  - Primarily composed of protein microtubules held together by connecting elements and surrounded by plasma
