Art is largely consider to be *sophisticated* and *subjective* with no objective interpretation or meaning. Why has the contemporary understanding of art, and more specifically controversial art, shifted in such a way that people have abandoned this mentality?

 

Are the necessarily racist through their existence?

- If so, why? What determines it?

- Does the interpretation one person have trump another person's interpretation?

  - Should the power of the few be able to impose their interpretation of an expressive and/or controversial piece of art?

Is it good to remove historical artwork if it accurately depicts history as it is known and understood?

- Presuming we know what is accurate/truthful, how do we determine what is a faithful depiction and/or interpretation of the artwork?

- What makes it good to remove artwork with historical depictions?

- Why do people make the assumption the images are empowering towards white people? Is there no other interpretation to this viewpoint?

  - Same question for the other side, the oppressed group/idea

Is it good faith to politicize artwork?

- Is it really white supremacy?

Is it really a relic and not a piece of history?

Is it really traumatizing? (Described as easy way to remove something you don't like in today's progressive and mentally aware society)

- Trauma can be brought on, not by an event, but by people telling other that they should be traumatized and "gaslighting" others into believing they should be traumatized.

  - Is this something that is happening in this situation?

- What makes it so psychologically impactful to groups of people?

- Is it the artwork that does it, or is it the interpretation that makes it so?

If we choose to leave artwork up but only cover certain portions, how do we determine which portions, and how is that reliably achieved without damaging the meaning?

 

*Why is artwork/statues just as bad as the event it was made to depict??*
