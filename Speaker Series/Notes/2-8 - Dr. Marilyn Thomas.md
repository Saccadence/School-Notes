  - Structural Racism in Education

    - Study black people in majority black school vs majority white school

      - Cause of difference may be from an underlying history of development

        - Black person in majority white community more likely to attend majority white school

          - They then can end up in majority white community as a result of education

  - Reach out to people who interest you

    - Network/Foot-in-the-Door

      - Can open doors for opportunity for higher education and career

        - Specific to research field, can apply to other fields as well that require networking to grow

 

Redline

- *Research more info*

 

Imposter Syndrome

- Speaker: Institutional force on individuals to make them feel they don't belong

  - Connection to systemic racism in their given circumstance

- Personal: Probably more of an existential crisis of rapid change

  - Feeling is probably influenced by systemic/institutional systems

    - In this case systemic racism

  - True source is going to be dependent on what space you occupy in society
