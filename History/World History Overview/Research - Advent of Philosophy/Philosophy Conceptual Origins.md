# Background
## Overview of Philosophy
> Philosophy is the attempt to give an account of what is true and what is important, based on rational assessment of evidence and arguments rather than myth, tradition, bald assertion, oracular utterances, local custom, or mere prejudice...many of the problems, concepts and approaches that became known as philosophy in Greece originated in other place and times. 
> The literary remains of oriental, Egyptian, and Hebrew cultures...display a fusion of what we call science, philosophy, and religion, though it usually referred to as mythology. [[Mythology]] is, in part, a primitive attempt to understand the world. In general mythopoeic (myth-making) thought has a different logical, imaginative, and emotional character than the kind of speculative thought that has come to characterize philosophy. (Page 1)<sup>1</sup>
## Early Philosophy Origins and Influences
### Middle-East and Asia
> To many nineteenth-century European scholars, "Asian origins" of Greek thought were inconceivable. We know now, however, that the Greek alphabet and system of writing came from Phoenicia (present-day Syria and Lebanon). Archives with documents preserved on clay tablets and even libraries of literary texts were inherited from the Babylonians and the Sumerians. The importance of written language, books, and libraries for the development of Greek thought cannot be overestimated...Iranian influence can also be seen in the Greek theological and cosmological systems developed in the late sixth and early fifth centuries, such as those in Homer, Hesiod, Alcman, and Thales, as well as in Pythagoras, who was known as a "priest-prophet" 
> The crucial period of this Iranian influence was from 750 to 600 B.C.E., when significant changes were occurring in the economic, social, and political organization. (Page 2)<sup>1</sup>
### Judeo-Christian
>"...the impact of Judeo-Christian thinking on the main stream of Western philosophy came somewhat later, not beginning until the [[Hellenistic Age]]. In particular, three ideas that have proven extremely fruitful for later Western thought derive from Judeo-Christianity and are not found in earlier Greek or Roman thought: creation, history, and personality." (Page 3)<sup>1</sup>
- Monotheism was not a new idea in Western philosophy (Xenophanes, Plato, Aristotle)
	- "Absolute transcendence of the biblical God, who creates the universe and thus becomes the ground of all existence, however, was a new concept"
### Egyptian
> In 1987, Martin Bernal...published published a most provocative book entitled [*Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Athena). The first part of this projected four-volume study is subtitled "The Fabrication of Ancient Greece, 1785-1985."...advanced the thesis that much of what we call "classical civilization" came from Egypt and Phoenician and Hebraic sources. He claimed that it was only when European racism came into full flower from the late eighteenth century onward that scholars tried to depict ancient Greece as a completely autonomous civilization.
> Bernal demonstrated that in ancient times Greek authors such as Herodotus and Plato traveled to Egypt, were much impressed by what they saw there, and brought their Egyptian experiences back home. (Page 3-5)<sup>1</sup>
- <u>Need to look into this source more</u> and how it has developed over time
	- Highly contentious among classical interpreters of Western philosophers
	- Only 2 volumes of the work were published at the time of the book
### Prephilosophic Greek Culture
>Wisdom (*sophia*), for example, can be seen as a traditional Greek value (see, for example, Homer, the *Iliad*, 2:15.42). Also there is an old list of seven sages (*sophoi* or *sophistai*) that provides a link from sophistry to philosophy...Generally, sophia refers to skill with words (as in poetry, thetoric, and knowledge) and deeds (as in politics). (Page 5)<sup>1</sup>
- References Thales for "disinterested science"
# Early Greek Philosophy
## Pre-Socratics
**Only secondary sources available - Aristotle being one of the earliest authors post Pre-Socratics**
### The Early Ionians
>A rational, as distinct from a mythological, approach to what we now consider philosophy is generally acknowledged to have been first elaborated in Miletus, Ionia (on what is now the western Turkish Mediterranean coast), by three thinkers: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. (Page 6)<sup>1</sup>
#### Thales
- Born mid-seventh century B.C.E.
	- Active early-sixth century B.C.E.
- Most knowledge derived from the writings of Aristotle
- Believed "that whatever was real is in some significant sense 'alive'."
#### Anaximander
- Born towards the end of the seventh century B.C.E.
- Believed "the explanatory principle of things is what he called of 'the *apeiron*,' a word that might be translated as 'the indefinite,' 'the boundless,' or both."
	- Possible it was immeasurably large temporally and/or physically
