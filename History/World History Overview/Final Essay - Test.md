# Chapter 15 - Europe in the Renaissance and Reformation - 1350 to 1600 C.E.
### Describe Renaissance art. What were its themes and techniques? (Be sure to include relevant examples.) How were artists trained? What was their status in society? Who was their audience?
The Renaissance (c. 1350-1520 C.E.) was a period of intense self-reflection and human social development, both internally and externally. This was especially found in the fundamental ideal of Humanism, one of the most notable being Francesco Petrarch (c. 1304-1374 C.E.). Humanists believed in the value of classic Latin literature and the works of the Roman Empire. This belief would later develop into what is now largely considered the liberal arts.
While many began to dissect and expand the ideas of previous literature by using the printing press to make their work more easily transmitted, others took to the world of art to express themselves. Artists were largely commissioned to design and produce artwork to help glorify themselves and/or their family. This culture of respect for humanists and artists, especially amongst the general public, was not present until the Renaissance where their individualism - a break from the largely religious implications (i.e. artists are only a vessel of God's work) - were valued more. Many Renaissance artists focused their themes towards religion early on but later began to develop more and more imagery with individuals and/or their families, classical designs, and the natural world. Many of these shifts in image themes came during the 15th century when the ideas of humanists began to spread and become more widely accepted.
As art began to spread more with these new found sets of themes, many artists began to pop-up such as Donatello - a sculptor - and Sanzio - one of the most sought out portrait painters. However, women were largely excluded from being artists and those that did, did so because of their training from their fathers who were also artists. Furthermore, most artists came from wealthier backgrounds with some exceptions such as Leonardo and Michelangelo. This dichotomy also extends to the audience of art which was mostly exclusive to educated and/or wealthy members of society. This made many Renaissance artists and writers (mostly by proxy) a part of, or at least respected by, the upper/elite classes in society at the time.
