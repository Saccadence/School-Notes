What is Sociology?

- "The Sociological Imagination" by Charles Wright Mills

  - The ability to see the linkage between the individual and larger society

  - Personal issues can be linked, to extent, to a societal issue(s)

 

Historical Origins of Sociology

- Three Things Needed for the Formation of Sociology

  - Scientific Revolution (1600's)

  - Democratic Revolution (1700's)

    - Post-Democratic: People shape society (not tradition, religion, leaders only)

  - Industrial Revolution (1800's)

    - Many social problems were created that never existed before

- Three Major Founders of Sociology:

  - Emile Durkheim

    - Why has the suicide rate increased? (1897)

      - Individuals with low levels of social solidarity (strength of relationships) will have a higher suicide rate

        - Also happens with high social solidarity due to the group being more important than yourself (Martyrdom, Self-Sacrifice)

      - Suicide is a social phenomenon

        - Not just a psychological problem

        - Things that occur external of you influence your thoughts and decision-making processes

    - Important to the development of statistical analysis in the field of Sociology

  - Karl Marx

    - "The Communist Manifesto" (1848); "Capital" (1867)

    - Hegel's Idealism

      - Ideas constitute and change society

      - Marx flipped this idea

    - Materialism

      - Humans are shaped by their <u>material</u> surroundings

      - (Economic Base) The economic structure shapes the rest of society

        - Hunter-Gatherer, Agricultural, Capitalistic, etc. (Dependent on the means of production and the usage of those means)

      - (Super-Structure) Religion, Law, Culture, Ideas, Language, etc. are based on the Economic Base

        - The economic structure determines societal emphasis and development

          - Necessity and availability will determine how things are shaped

            - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (*talk more about it*)

    - Marx and Capitalism

            - Destruction of whole government, work environment, economic system

          - Didn't happen the way he predicted (Factory-based economies)

            - Russia and China (agricultural) had revolutions

            - Didn't see rise of middle-class and unionization of workers (compromise) as a possibility

              - 40-hours (overtime if more), safer conditions

        - Commodities take on a mystical quality

- What Causes Social Movements to Emerge

  - Three Necessary Components of Social Movements

    - Resource Mobilization Theory - "How?"

      - Social Movements arise when there is a strong organizational and resource base

        - Removal of the burden of the average person to invest their own resources into the movement while also providing a structured, well-led force to enact change

          - Brings more people into the movement longer and more consistently

          - *The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement* by Aldon Morris

            - The urban black church was the institutional center of the Civil Rights Movement

        - Organizations help build "strong ties" between members

          - Unification to a common goal, held together by strong bonds that keep every individual going

            - Best chance to enact effective change

        - Helps us understand the "how" of social movements

      - How is the Internet Changing the Nature of Social Movements?

    - Political Opportunities - "When?"

      - Refers to dimensions of the political environment that either encourage/discourage people from acting

        - Positive

          - Ability to engage in political reform/social movements is possible or even encouraged

        - Negative

          - Ability to engage in political reform/social movements is very difficult or even dangerous/lethal

      - The main insight is that Social Movements develop when there are opening/shifts in political power

        - How do political opportunities increase?

          - Elites may become divided

          - Elites may support the movement

      - State Suppression of Movements

        - Make Concessions

        - Co-optation

        - Sabotage

        - Use Violence

      - Cycles of Protest

        - If movements succeed, they often produce broader cycles that spread

    - Frames - "Why?"

      - The way movements assign meaning to and interpret events in ways that are intended to mobilize adherents

        - Help us understand the "why" of social movements

      - 3 Main Components - DPM

        - Diagnostic

          - Identifies a problem

        - Prognostic

          - Suggests solution

        - Motivational

          - "Call to Arms"

      - Master Frames

        - Connection of smaller frames together

          - Build one big movement from multiple smaller, less powerful movements

      - Counter Frames

        - Oppositional frame to vilify or delegitimize the original frame

          - Aims to weaken or dismantle the protesting frame
