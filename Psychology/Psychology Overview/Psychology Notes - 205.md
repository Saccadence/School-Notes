2.  Explain common ethical dilemmas associated with different social science research techniques

3.  Identify various social scientific principals embedded in various research designs

 

 

Epistemology and Science

- How do we truly know anything? Anecdotes, Statistics, and Logic. What do we value more?

  - Pragmatic

    - Explanations that give the ability to make an informed change

  - Semantic

    - "Translate" understanding from one reality to another

  - Syntactic

    - Good logical structure (semi-syllogistic) that has data-driven premises and a sound conclusion

    - Usually deductive

- My Definition of Science

  - The pursuit of knowledge, no matter how flawed or absurd, to explain our reality.

    - Modern-day science is built on normative systems of procedure while determinations relies on human consensus.

      - Community of Researchers

      - Norms and Beliefs

      - Scientific Methods

      - Journals

- Epistemology

  - The study of knowledge and how we distinguish valid from invalid claims to knowledge

  - Common Types of Knowledge:

    - Authority

    - Tradition (authority of the past)

    - Common Sense

    - Personal Experience

    - Science & Social Science

- Social Science

  - Disciplines that study aspects of the social world

    - Relevant to Theory

    - Use Large Amounts of Purposely Collected Data

    - Systematic Analysis

  - Objectivity

    - Positivists

      - Assume social science can discover the absolute laws of social behavior

      - Modern-day social sciences no longer generally take this stance

        - People do not follow laws like in nature

          - No set boundary for individual actions

          - Intentionally/Agency

        - Research is value-driven and biased

          - Researchers have their own set of values and intentions that need to be examined

            - Internal and external influences

    - Postmodernism (1970-1990)

      - Research is value-laden and involves forms of power relations

        - Researchers don't hone in on biases, but they do influence the way they think

    - How to combat biases?

      - Use techniques that minimize bias and expose power relations

        - Control for those biases in your research

          - Know yourself in order to target those

          - Have others check your work

  - May be imperfect but it can help navigate through the complex social world

    - (Example) Navigation w/old maps when first discovering the world, misunderstanding of things we see

 

 

The Purposes and Processes of Social Research

- Goals of Research (Ragin 1998):

  - Identify Patterns and Relationships

  - Testing and Refining Theories

  - Making Predictions

  - Interpreting Culturally and Historically Significant Phenomena

    - Interpreting meaning from events

  - Exploring Diversity

    - Understanding the complexity of different situations

  - Giving Voice

    - Bring awareness to an unknown population of people

  - Advancing New Theories

    - The development of new ideas

- Foundational Types of Data (Ragin)

  - Quantitative

    - Number of things (essentially counting)

    - Few aspects/features of a relatively large number of cases

  - Qualitative

    - Characteristics of something(s) observed

    - Many aspects/features of a relatively small number of cases

  - Comparative

    - Middle ground of Quantitative and Qualitative

    - Decent aspects/features of a decent number of cases

 

 

Social Theory and Data Analysis

- Gathering

  - Theories

    - Help us see the world in particular ways

  - Data

    - Refer to the evidence that researchers collect from the world

- Interpretation

  - Analysis (of Facts or Events)

    - Breaking things down into parts and viewing those parts in relation to the whole

  - Synthesis

    - Putting all the parts together to make sense of them

      - Making connections that at first glance seem unconnected

- Research Orientations

  - Fixed Research Orientations (Syntactic)

    - Theories are elaborated at the outset of the research and remain fixed for the duration of the research

      - Hypothesis Testing

  - Fluid Research Orientations (Semantic)

    - Shows where to look and what kinds of factors may be important without any specific hypotheses

      - Doesn't necessitate a hypothesis to begin research

      - Searching and Accessing Data

        - What to look for? How do you find it?

          - Data is not always easy to find and, even if found, it can be anywhere in the world

      - Authenticity of Data

        - How do you know it is real?

      - Internal Validity

      - Distinguish Contemporary and Historical Understanding of Words and Ideas

        - Avoid using contemporary/personal understandings when historically it meant something different

    - History is rooted in data but only makes since tied into a narrative or theoretical framework

  - Content Analysis

    - A set of methods for analyzing the content of communication

      - Using systematic counting and recording procedures to carry out an analysis of a text

    - Goal:

      - Reduce the content of the text to a set of units that represent something important

    - *Face-ism* by D. Archer et. al (1983)

      - Hypothesis:

        - Facial prominence of men and women should reflect societal view on gender

      - Method:

        - Quantitative analysis of thousands of pictures

        - Created an index

          - Measurement from The Top of Head to The Chin/The Top of the Head to The Lowest Point on the Body

      - Findings:

        - Men, on average, had more prominence of their head in relation to the rest of their body

    - Coding System

      - Refers to the rules stating how the text is to be systematically measured

        - Types:

          - Manifest Coding

            - Refers to the coding of information from the visible or surface content of a text

              - Smaller units may be coded more reliably, but their meanings are harder to decipher

          - Latent Coding

            - Refers to the coding of the underlying meaning in the content of a text

              - Larger units are easier to extract meaning, but harder to code

      - *Brokered Boundaries* by Massey and Sanchez (2011)

        - Quota sample of 159 1<sup>st</sup> generation Latino immigrants

          - Method:

            - Gave 2 cameras to each person to take pictures of things that fit in with the label on the camera (16 people)

              - 1 labeled American, 1 labeled Latino

          - Findings:

            - American-ness

              - Abstract symbols/objects

            - Latino-ness

              - More social/interpersonal

 

 

Field Research

- Ethnography

  - Seeks to provide a description and understanding of a way of life from the standpoint of the members of a community

    - *Becoming a Marijuana User* by Howard Becker

      - Smoking is a socially learned process

      - Three Barriers to Becoming a Pothead:

        - Learn to smoke effectively

        - Learn to recognize the effects

        - Learn to enjoy sensations

    - Underlying Epistemology:

      - Naturalism

        - We learn best by observing ordinary events in natural settings (and not in contrived ones)

    - Ideal for Micro-Level Analysis and Analyzing How People Construct Social Meanings

      - Strengths:

        - Natural environment

        - Detailed, qualitative case study(s)

      - Weaknesses:

        - Not generalizable

        - Difficult to validate the interpretations in the study

  - *Identity Work Among the Homeless* by Snow and Anderson

    - Associational Distancing

      - Seeing themselves as different from those they associate with

  - Methodological Empathy

    - Understanding of people's actions from their point of view (Empathy and not Sympathy)

      - In some ways, Ethnography is the most democratic of research methods

        - Researcher not in control

    - Useful for developing theory

      - Little knowledge about subject when going into study

      - Often exploratory and descriptive

  - Common Methodological Issues

    - How do you know if the interpretation is valid?

      - Combine Methods

        - Observation

        - Participation

        - Interviewing

      - Explore Alternative Explanations

      - Corroborate Your Information with Outside Sources

      - Get Feedback

    - One test of validity is when people in comparable settings recognize the descriptions they read (Alder)

  - Methodological Techniques

    - How close do you get?

      - Outsiders

        - Faster and Easier to Collect Data

          - More Superficial

        - More "Objective"

          - Emotional Distancing

      - Insiders

        - More Access to Information

          - More Emotional Attachment

        - Risk "Going Native"

          - Drop researcher role and become a member of the community

            - Common in Ethnography

              - Even if they don't go through with it, they struggle to leave or at least think about staying

  - Conducting Ethnographies

    - Be Self-Aware

      - Your personal characteristics are relevant

    - How Will You Gain Access?

    - Decide How Much to Disclose

      - Covert

        - Unfiltered reactions as if you were just another person

          - But can be seen as ethically problematic

      - Open

        - Open discussions about theories/ideas and get real-time feedback

          - But responses and attitudes may not be as natural

      - Continuum from cover to open research

        - What will be your cover story?

    - Normalization

      - Refers to how a researcher becomes comfortable with the researcher

        - How will you build trust?

    - Decide on Degree of Involvement

    - Adopt an "Attitude of Strangeness"

      - Researcher examines and questions everything as if they're a stranger

    - Always Take Copious Notes

    - Sampling

      - Take selective observations

        - Convenience Sampling

      - Use unstructured, non-directive in-depth interviews

    - Use Informants

    - Before You Begin, Figure Out When Are Going to Leave and Write the Report

  - Structure of Ethnography

    - 

| Select Setting  | Select Topic |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Gain Access     |              |
| Present Oneself | Create Role  |
| Take Notes      | Analysis     |
| Leave           | Write Report |

 

 

Science, Paradigms, and Reflexivity

- Science and Epistemology

  - Social Science is one of the most important ways that we "know" about the world

  - Science is a social institution

    - Community

    - Journals

    - Norms/Beliefs

    - Accepted Methods

  - Science is a product of cultural, technological, and organization forces

- Ethics

  - Scientists work within the dominant paradigm until a new one replaces it

    - If science is so problematic, what can the researcher do?

- Useful Questions

  - Science for whom?

    - Who is conducting the research?

    - Who is funding the research?

    - Who benefits?

  - Knowledge for what?

    - What is the purpose of the research?

      - Does the public have access?

- Pierre Bourdieu

  - Minimize Bias

    - Reflexivity

      - The process whereby the researcher takes into account his/her social location and cultural views when conducting research

        - Individual Level

          - What are my beliefs and values?

        - Institutional Level

          - What biases exist in my academic field?

          - What kinds of competitive pressures are there?

        - Theoretical Level

          - Am I unfairly imposing my theories onto the people I am studying?
