# Practice Activity 2.1/2.2
## Suppose that the height *s* of a ball (in feet) at time *t* (in seconds) is given by the formula $$ s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2 $$
#### (a)
Construct and accurate graph on the interval of 0 to 3. Find six distinct points including release, apex, and landing.
#### (b)
In everyday language, describe the behavior of the ball in that interval. What occurs at t = 1?
#### (c)
Consider the expression: $$ AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{s(1)-s(0.5)}{1-0.5} $$
