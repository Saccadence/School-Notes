### Consciousness
#### Types Distinguished
- Phenomenal
	- Arguably the central notion of consciousness
	- 'what-is-it-likeness'
		- What is it like to be something or someone?
			- What would it be like to be a cow? A phone? A rock? etc.
		- The more intuitive feeling of consciousness when people invoke the idea of it in some way
- Access
	- Ned Block (1995)
	- Explicitly functional, dispositional feature of psychological entities
		- The availability of information to the psychological mechanisms and systems responsible for things like thinking, reasoning, planning, and action control
- Self-consciousness
	- The capacity to think of oneself
		- Being able to see and acknowledge that one is themselves
		- The ability to connect the mind with the body
			- See oneself in the mirror and acknowledge what you're seeing and/or interacting with in that reflection is yourself
				- Recent [example in a mouse]([Mice pass a key test of consciousness | The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/4342858-mice-pass-a-key-test-of-consciousness/)) (hyperbolic title, but still indicative of the point to some degree)
- Creature
	- David Rosenthal (2002)
	- The conscious state of a creature
		- Not being unconscious (asleep or knocked out) makes them conscious
### Moral Status
#### Operational Definition
- "Thought to generate prima facie reasons against harming or killing an entity, as well as prima facie reasons against frustrating its interests"
	- Consciousness is the deriving factor behind these prima facie (intuitions) moral judgements
- Lack of consciousness (minimally conscious - inconsistent but some degree of consciousness)
	- *Lack of*  interest in continuing to live
		- The conscious (or the once conscious in this case) being is the thing that exhibits interests and the lack of consciousness implies a lack of exhibiting interests
		- Morally non-intuitive to the way we normally examine humans, especially those of which who are unconscious
			- We grant some amount of moral consideration to beings that are not currently conscious. Why?
				- Value a previous conscious experience and maybe we think that acting on behalf of a being with a previously conscious state (and a potential conscious state) would be us imposing/overriding the wishes of said being
				- Some may view this from the lens of a potential future consciousness alone and that acting in a way that would affect this being is to impose/override the interests of said being
				- Others may just view it only from the lens that the being is alive and that as a being that lives it has some amount of moral consideration. (Creature Consciousness)
		- Posited in the paper as not solely a lack of consciousness but rather as a "lack of capacity to engage in worthwhile activities"
			- However there is evidence that some (likely very small number) who are unresponsive to external stimuli are in fact conscious
				- Shows that consciousness is more than likely a fundamental concept of which we use to derive moral consideration
#### The Role of Consciousness
- Following some of the evidence from Permanent Vegetative State (PVS) patients potentially having some amount of preserved consciousness, our notion of what should and shouldn't receive moral consideration changes based on how much we value this conscious experience
	- Leads to ideas/discussions around AI and non-human animals if they are deemed to possess consciousness
- Claim that many of the notions of moral consideration call upon phenomenal consciousness more specifically
	- Some claims to sentientism (Jeff Sebo) regarding moral status:
		- a) If you are sentient, then you have interests
		- b) If you have interests, then you are capable of being harmed
		- c) If you are capable of being harmed, then moral agents have at least prima facie duty not to harm you
		- d) If moral agents have at least prima facie moral duty not to harm you, then you have at least a prima facie moral right, against these moral agents, not to be harmed
	- If you are sentient, then moral agents have a prima facie duty not to harm you and vice versa
		- Not sure about this claim just yet, logically it makes sense but something feels off about it
			- Paper mentions some concerns that I think resonate with my intuitive feeling:
				- Why is sentience necessary for the possession of a present subjective motivation state?
					- Questionable framing or even a plainly improper question for an argument that isn't made
				- Why is possession of such states sufficient for the capacity to be harmed as well as the generation of prima facie rights against such harm?
					- I resonate with this more, my general first impression is that there is some amount of *begging the question* that is occurring here
						- More specifically with the notion of prima facie duty and somewhat with the notion/usage of harm in the argument
##### Intrinsic Value of Some Phenomenal Mental States
- Feldman (1997), Goldstein (1989), Kahane (2009), Rachels (2000)
	- At the least, pleasure is intrinsically valuable and, at the least, pain is intrinsically disvaluable
- Kahane's views (mentioned usage of him more for expository reasons)
	- Suffering is *objective in nature*, not subject to interpretation, which gives one prima facie moral reason to end that state regardless of sufferer
		- "Suffering's badness supervenes on the character of an agent's total experiential state"
		- Also thinks that the hedonistic inversion of suffering is "not a suggestion we can make sense of"
	- Suffering is bad because of phenomenal character
		- Not asserted by previous claims, but claims it is best explanation presented thus far
	- Ascribes objective value to at least some phenomenally conscious states
###### Building to Moral Status
- From Objectivism (value of phenomenal states) to Moral Status:
	- Psychological subject holds *objective* value in entering valuable mental states
	- Merits certain treatment in accordance to this *objective* value
	- Prima facie, we ought not frustrate the subject's attempts to enter into such states or cause the subject to move out of these states into disvaluable states
