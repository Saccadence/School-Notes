Unit 2

"Ontological Argument"

- Term not used by Anselm

- Invented by Immanuel Kent in 1700's

 

Conclusion of Anselm

- Defend theism through the existence of God

- Only works for people who have some faith in God

- Greater understanding of God for those that believe

 

Faith and Reason

- Must have faith in God in order to understand God

 

Epistemic Claims

- Emotionally resistant to an idea

  - Prevents understanding of God

 

Religious Faith

- Believe without understanding

- Revealed truths

  - Truths given to humans directly from God

 

Anselm's Definition of God

- God is nothing greater that can be conceived

  - Attributes:

    - Creator of universe

    - Omniscient

    - Best morally good

    - Omnipotent

  - Issues:

    - Don't know the 'greatest' thing I can think of

    - Takes actions that would be deemed morally evil

    - All-knowing but we have to ask him for help through prayer

 

Reduction to Absurdity

- Assume the opposite of what you think is true

- Pair it with things you know to be true, at least for the purpose of argumentation

- Lead to a contradiction - Force the other person to drop their position in the face of a contradiction

- Infer the opposite of the assumption

- If X, then Y. Not Y (nothing to back up the claim). Contradiction of Y and therefore X cannot be true.

 

Anselm's Ontological Argument

(Ontology - Study of Things (The Nature of Things), Ontological Argument - Prove God's Existence as a Definitional Truth)

- Definition of God

- Assume that God is nothing greater that can be conceived *only* exists within one's understanding

- If you can think of something, then it also exists within the confines of a conceptualized reality

- If God did exist in reality, than God in reality would be greater that the idea of God

- If God only exists in your mind, it would be a contradiction because God in reality would be greater than God in a conceptualized reality

 

Cosmological Argument

- Aquinas (Ways 1-4)

- There must be something to begin everything

- Everything acquires change from some external thing, cannot go to infinity

 

Teleological

- End/Purpose

- Intelligent Design

- Non-conscious things work towards an intelligent end (complexity) that cannot be derived from itself, comes from God

 

Pascal

- Pragmatic Argument

  - Early version - Wagering in God's existence you gain everything but lose nothing

    - Makes more sense through reasoning to assume God exists

- Moral Argument

  - Gain goodness from belief in God

- Limits of Human Mind

  - Infinite that humans don’t know

  - We know of infinity's existence, but not it's nature

  - God - Infinitely incomprehensible

    - Pascal is still useful to reason about the question of God

    - Know God through faith

  - "In glory we shall know God's nature"

  - Heaven/Afterlife

- The Wager

  - Option 1 - God is

  - Option 2 - God is not

    - If polytheism is true, then Pascal's understand of God is false

  - Pascal - Don't wager on a coin flip (50/50)

    - With God, you have to play

  - You have already begun on the journey of life

    - Pascal - no one knows/can prove if there is an afterlife

  - If you don't believe in God by the time you die (even if never exposed to the concept), you chose to not believe in God

- Unbeliever?

  - Act as if you believe

    - Belief voluntarism actions create our values

  - Perform the ritual/norms of a religion

- Moral Argument for Belief in God

  - Certain gains come in your mortal life

    - Faithful

    - Honest

    - Humble

    - Generous

  - Reason someone may contradict those moral gains

    - Selfish

    - Not true believer

  - If you truly believe, you would try to not act immorally in fear of being judged by an all-knowing god

- Objections to Pascal

  - Which religion/god is to believe in?

    - What if you choose wrong

      - Can still be morally good and be close enough to real religion

  - Isn't wagering on belief in God's existence selfish/immoral?

    - Might start as fear but become positive over time

    - Be morally good

Unit 4 - Ethical Theories and Justice

- Determine what is morally right and wrong

  - Normative Ethical Theory

    - A general standard for determining moral right and wrong

    - General Standard can be applied to personal, professional, and public lives

- Three Historically Influential Ethical Theories

  - Virtue Ethics

    - Aristotle as one version of virtue ethics

    - Judgement of character and not actions/intentions

    - Focus on developing virtuous character traits

      - Character Traits - Psychological disposition to feel or act a certain way (some genetic, others are through experience and habits)

      - Virtuous - Something that is morally good

        - Opposite is called a vice - Vicious person is someone who acts according to a vice

    - Examples: Honesty, Loyalty, Trustworthy, Compassion, Kindness, Benevolence, Fortitude, Courage, Bravery, Patience, Curiosity, Temperance (Aristotle's most important virtue)

  - Deontology

    - Immanuel Kent presents one version

    - John Rawls's account of justice is another version of deontological

  - Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)

    - Covered in Ethics class

    - Least harm possible

 

- Aristotle - Nicomachean Ethics

  - Teleological View of Nature - Universe designed with everything having a purpose but may not be achieving that function

  - Common end goal is to do good

  - Modern Biology goes against teleological view

    - Darwin and not everything in nature do not serve a function

    - Extinction not understood until 1700s

    - Nature is no longer a well-oiled machine

  - Hierarchy of Good - Every specific good is part of a general hierarchy of crafts

    - Politics is the master craft as it has control over all over crafts and how many people do them

  - Highest good for humans is happiness to Aristotle

    - Happiness (Eudaemonic): Flourishing = Feeling of Pleasant Satisfaction

      - Happiness is not temporary feeling/psychological state

      - Flourishing Life: A life in which you fulfill your capabilities

  - Three Lives

    - Happiness as vulgar good

      - Most common view of happiness

    - Happiness as being honored/remembered by your community

    - Happiness as pursuing knowledge/wisdom

      - Aristotle - most fulfilling kind of happiness

      - The Contemplative Life

  - Function of Humans

    - Aristotle using argument by elimination

    - Something that is not found in all living things

    - Rational Activity - Aristotle thinks this is humans' function/end

  - Requirements for achieving the highest good

    - A lot has to go right for someone to live a fully happy life

    - Moral virtue is necessary

    - Being virtuous doesn't guarantee that you will be happy

    - Everyone requires means to their ends

      - Friends, political power, and riches

      - Extra: Being raised and being born in a good way, being good looking

 

- Kant - Deontology

  - Deontology - Standard based on identifying moral duties

    - Intentions are important in morality, not the effects

    - A universal objective standard

    - Any being who can understand reasoning are moral agents

  - Unqualified good in the Universe is Good Will

    - Wishing does not mean willing. Willing is a much more actionable desire, you are trying to do to it in every possible way

  - Hypothetical Imperative

    - An action that is good because it is a means to an end

  - Categorical Imperative

    - An action that is good in itself and morally necessary

    - Can be used to find 'good will' through action and testing

    - "Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law"

      - Maxim - general policy/intention (focus on morally relevant factors)

        - Take particular intention and strip references to particular people, places, times

  - Universality

    - Unable to make exceptions/be a hypocrite

    - Everyone acts on the same moral foundations

    - Limit chaos and anarchy as everyone acts on the moral foundations, unless they are morally evil

    - Potentially Maxims that are Universalizable

      - Don't harm others

      - Self Defense

        - Only in situations of immediate bodily harm

  - Basic Structure of Society

    - Political Constitutions

    - Principle Economic Arrangements

    - Principle Social Arrangements

  - Original Position of Equality

    - Like Categorical Imperative, goal is to be impartial reason

      - Rational Choice Theory - Modern Idea (Economic and Social Behavior - 1800/1900)

    - Thought experiment replaces "state of nature" accounts

      - Asking you to step back from personal life

    - Thought experiment does imply some view of human nature

  - Essential Features of Original Position

    - No one knows place in society (Veil of Ignorance) - Strip away your knowledge of your place in society

      - Social status

      - Natural talents

      - Conceptions of good

      - Specific personality

    - Used to derive the principles of justice

      - Not designed for day-to-day life

      - Designed for voting and refining key processes

      - Might help identify bias

  - Two Principles of Justice

    - 1st - Equal set of basic liberties compatible for all people

      - Freedom if thought/speech/association

      - Freedom from arbitrary arrest or seizure of property

      - Freedom from psychological oppression

    - 2nd - Social and Economic inequality are to be arranged such that:

      - Both are reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage

      - Attached to positions and offices that are open to all

    - Thinks 1st principle is more and important/fundamental than the 2nd

  - Maxi-Min Reasoning

- Rawls vs Baier

  - Rawls:

    - Need to take care of justice

      - First virtue of social institutions

    - Then take care of other moral concerns

    - Things would be inherently flawed if you don't take care of justice

  - Baier:

    - Cannot do justice alone

    - Must do justice and care equally

    - Says Rawls is "one-eyed" perspective

      - Not considering every important factor

 

- Gender Differences in Ethics

  - Baier

    - Doesn't believe/is skeptical of innate gender differences in ethics

  - Chodorow's Hypothesis

    - Gender of primary caretaker has important influence on child's moral development

      - Statistically speaking, women are the primary caretaker for reasons relating to their gender

    - Evil of Isolation

      - Associated with Females

      - Solution Community

    - Evil of Powerlessness

      - Associated with Males

      - Independence Autonomy

  - Lawrence-Kohlberg Test

    - Piaget's theory of child development + Kant moral theory

  - Carol Colligan's Critique

    - Men consistently scored higher on Kohlberg test

    - Issue: Autonomy shouldn't be the highest exclusive standard of moral development

 

- Main Problem with Rawls' view of society

  - Even if we achieved a perfectly just society, we could still be miserable

    - Meaningless lives

  - Rawls:

    - Do care about secondary concerns

    - Shouldn't obligate people to care for others

    - People should be more caring in a just society

 

- Care as an Optional Extra?

  - Would exploit some groups of people

    - Traditional Caretakers being exploited

  - Ignores/overlooks inequality in relationships

  - Rights are inadequate as guides for living

  - Need to promote "positive" emotions rather than just taming "negative" emotions

 

 

 

Unit 5 - Freedom, Determinism, and Moral Responsibility

 

- Moral Responsibility

  - Accountability for your actions, good and bad

  - Those who do not typically qualify under this definition:

    - Young Kids

    - People who lose independent legal status

    - Serious mental conditions

    - Loss of basic cognitive capabilities

 

- Relevant Legal definitions and information

  - Mitigating Circumstances

    - A factor that lessens a person's responsibility for an action or completely eliminates any punishment for a criminal action

  - Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity

    - Person is innocent because they were incapable of understanding right/wrong during this time of their action

    - Required to seek treatment, often spend as much if not more time in psychiatric care

  - Guilty but Mentally Ill

    - Sentenced to treatment and then they go to prison

>  

- Free Will vs Determinism

  - Free Will

    - Intersection of choice where one can equally choose to pick one over any of the others

  - Determinism

    - Set of choices that can be made but only one is possible in our future

      - Our limited knowledge is the only reason why we don't know what is going to happen

>  

- Punishment vs Controlling Action

  - Punishment

    - Broad: Harm someone

      - Person won't like how they are treated

    - Narrow: Correct behavior by teaching them a lesson

      - Aim to change person's behavior or prevent other from acting the same

      - "Teaching a lesson" implies the person will choose to act differently after suffering the punishment

      - Hold a person accountable for a bad action they did not have to do, therefore they are responsible

  - Controlling Action

    - Controlling something that isn't a moral agent

      - Passive or Active Measures

 

 

 

Frankfurt

 

- The Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)

  - "A person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise"

  - Can be used in:

    - Cases of coercion - Threaten a person in order to pressure them

      - Physical Threats

      - Verbal Threats

      - Blackmail

      - Brainwashed/Hypnosis

- Counters to PAP

  - Jones commits crime before Mr. Black coerces him

    - Mr. Black is aware of Jones' intention

      - Only going to coerce if they change their mind

    - Can Jones do something other than commit the crime?

      - No, Jones cannot do otherwise

      - Jones' action is "overdetermined"

        - There are several sufficient causal factors that will lead to the event

          - The intention

          - Mr. Black coercing Jones' if he doesn't follow through

    - He is both responsible and not responsible

      - Responsible due to action on own intention and not on the basis of coercion

- Revised PAP

  - "A person is morally responsible for what he has done only because he could have done otherwise"

 

- Compatibilism

  - Free will and determinism can coexist

    - PAP

- Incompatibilism

  - Free will or determinism

 

- The Deep Self View

  - Frankfurt's account of moral responsibility as one example

  - The action reflects who you are/want to be

    - Similar to Kant's "willing" an action

 

 

 

Wolf - Deep Self

 

- Wolf's Jojo Counterexample

  - Jojo is son of Jo

    - Jo is an evil dictator

  - Jo raises Jojo to become evil dictator

  - Wolf says Jojo is insane (no one could grow up to be morally good in this situation)

- Is Jojo Responsible for his Actions as a Dictator?

  - If he isn't, people can excuse all bad actions with rough childhood

 

- Sane Deep Self View

  - Wolf's definition of sanity - minimum ability to cognitively and normatively recognize the world for what it is

  - Normative Sanity

    - It is possible for you to correct your values and behavior

  - Objections

    - How do "we" know that we're sane?

      - Socially agreed upon understanding of sanity

        - Strong indicator but not definitive

      - Forms of widespread normative insanity today?

        - Eating the flesh of other animals

        - Amounts of personal consumer goods

    - Does her account make all bad people insane?

      - There is a difference between having an ability and using an ability

        - Ability to "self-correct"

 

 

 

Robert Sapolsky - Behave

 

- Reform Criminal Justice System?

  - Wants to actually abolish it because biology affects so much of one's behavior that people shouldn’t be punished for their biological predispositions

    - Reformation is akin to witch trials and using science to better punish witches

  - Removal of "free will" is important to understanding why people do something

Christian Wenzel - On Daoism and Zhuangzi

 

- Fasting One's Mind

  - Woodworker Example:

    - Stop "thinking" about everything and just do it

    - Stayed in woods for 7 days - no wood carving

    - Forgets he even has limbs and a body

 

- Daoist Self

  - Spontaneous (vs planned/deliberate actions)

  - Always Transforming (changed by situations)

 

- Responsiveness

  - Situation

    - Yan Hui example:

      - Talking to ruler to convince him to change his mind

        - Get into ruler's mindset

        - Immersed in conversation

      - Don't want to insult them

        - Need to hide intention

  - Reason

  - Can always look at something in a new way

  - Can always do the right thing

 

 

 

Unit 6 - Existential Issues

 

Jenann Ismael - "The Ethical Importance of Death"

 

- Ismael's Conclusion

  - Death gives meaning to life

  - Death defines the actions we take and the overall life we live

 

- How we talk about death today?

  - Death should be avoided

  - Not seen as a natural part of life

  - Easy to recognize that humans die, but lack of awareness of mortality

    - Death of Ivan Ilych

      - On deathbed, is shocked to realize they are going to die

  - Rare to be around death

 

- Ismael's Definition of Death

  - Permanent End (No Afterlife)

    - Clean sweep of psychological state

  - Ethically beneficial that there is a permanent endpoint

 

- Leo Tolstoy's Question

  - Does a path to annihilation matter?

    - Destroyed into nothingness

    - Nihilism

  - Believes in immortal afterlife in order for life to have meaning

    - Religious

 

- Ismael's Alternative to Tolstoy and Hedonists

  - Compares eating a meal to an entire human life

    - Appetizer - Looking forward to the Entrée

    - Entrée - Looking forward to Dessert

    - Dessert - Full and look back on meal and saying it was a good meal

  - Human Life

    - Enjoy moments of life, move to next moment with new memory(s)

    - Immortality would be too much (full stomach)

 

 

Charles Tandy - Extraterrestrial Liberty and the Great Transmutation

 

- Two Senses of Liberty

  - Freedom to do what I want

  - Freedom from ignorance (Omniscient)

 

- Transmutation Hypothesis

  - The "Technological Singularity"

    - Technology overtakes humans in primary agents of history and finding new scientific advancements

    - Robots

 

- Future Liberties of Transhumanity

  - Fienberg's Law

    - Anything within the bounds of natural law will become a reality

    - Tandy adds that things, such as transhumans, may be able to violate natural laws and become a reality

 

- Extra-Terrestrial Green Habitat (EGC's)

  - Living outside of Earth or any planet

    - Would allow unlimited space

 

 

 

Samuel Scheffler - The Afterlife

 

- Conclusion

  - Lots of our motivations depend on the things being around after we die

  - Afterlife - Life after we die

    - Natural world, not supernatural

 

- Doomsday Scenario

  - Reaction, from the general populace, to the change in reality:

    - Not worried about legacy

    - Would be a massive change to life

    - What is bad/good becomes meaningless or pleasures become the focus of decisions

    - Activism: try to get people to see the truth before the end

    - Pragmatic Reaction: Assume the world won't end

    - Operate with hope that whatever is happening, you can mitigate/fix it

  - What reaction Scheffler wants/believes:

    - It would be profoundly depressing to you

    - Three Main Inferences:

      - Non-experiential

      - Non-consequential

      - Conservative

 

- Personal Relationship to the Future

  - We live on through our relationships to other people

  - Future is similar to a party you left early

  - Individuals invest themselves in social identities to help cope with death

    - Community of visual artists

    - Philosophers

    - People with the same language

    - Etc.

 

- "Children of Men" Thought Experiment

  - No more children are being born

    - Depressing for all humans

  - Reaction of people who don’t want children because of a world crisis

    - Depressing for them because it shows that the world is doomed

  - Difference from "Doomsday Scenario"

    - All humans live their normal lifespans

    - Still depressing without premature death

  - Both scenarios have the same problem of not being able to pass anything along after we die
