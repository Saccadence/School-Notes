Some Important/Interesting Terms that Appeared in the West Reading

- Pragmatism

  - “Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that – very broadly – understands knowing the world as inseparable from agency within it” (Legg and Hookway – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Pragmatism).

  - Pragmatism is also notable as the most distinct and recognizable philosophy that has originated in the United States.

- “The myth of the given” (20)

  - Cornel West writes, "American pragmatism rejects the idea of knowledge as a private affair where one begins with uninterpreted givens, theory-free entities, self-authenticating episodes, or intrinsically credible beliefs. Rather, it conceives of knowledge as within the conceptual framework of intersubjective, communal inquiry. ... For American pragmatists, the myth of the given must be demythologized" (20).

- Genteel Tradition in American Culture (38)

  - Cornel West references the “genteel tradition” in multiple parts of Chapter 1.

  - The word “genteel” literally means being polite and respectable and usually implies someone has high social status or wants to be viewed as having high social status. But West intends a more specific and substantial meaning when he speaks of America’s “genteel tradition”

  - West adopts the meaning of the term “genteel” from Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana:

    - To Santayana, the agonized conscience of Calvinism and the metaphysical comfort of transcendentalism weighted like a genteel incubus upon the American mind, partly explaining the odd American juxtaposition of intellectual conservatism with technological inventiveness (West 29).

  - West’s most detailed description of the genteel tradition:

    - American culture during the provincial period culminated in the Calvinist pietism, Enlightenment rationalism, and liberal republicanism of William Ellery Channing. The vernal American Schleiermacher, Channing is the pivotal figure of the Genteel tradition, in its transition from Calvinism to transcendentalism, at the turning point between the colonial provinciality and the postcolonial provinciality in American culture. His revolutionary humanitarianism, bordering on utopian socialism, condemned slavery, bigotry, and pagan worldliness. He proposed to overcome these through Christian pietism, moral use of scientific knowledge, and the perfection of human nature through self-realization in democratic communities (West 30).

- Calvinism

  - A Protestant branch of Christianity that emphasizes the importance of original sin on human nature. More specifically, its tenant of “total depravity” holds that Adam and Eve’s original sin is so fundamental to human nature that it permeates every part of human existence (Groenhout in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Sin in Christian Thought).

- Transcendentalism

  - Transcendentalism is a social and intellectual American movement that was most influential in the mid-1800s. It emphasized the goodness of solitude in nature. In the Stanford Encyclopedia entry on Transcendentalism, Russell Goodman writes,

    - Stimulated by English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, and the skepticism of Hume, the transcendentalists operated with the sense that a new era was at hand. They were critics of their contemporary society for its unthinking conformity, and urged that each person find, in Emerson’s words, “an original relation to the universe”(O, 3). Emerson and Thoreau sought this relation in solitude amidst nature, and in their writing. By the 1840s they, along with other transcendentalists, were engaged in the social experiments of Brook Farm, Fruitlands, and Walden; and, by the 1850s in an increasingly urgent critique of American slavery. transcendentalists, were engaged in the social experiments of Brook Farm, Fruitlands, and Walden; and, by the 1850s in an increasingly urgent critique of American slavery.

  - Principle of Causation (Reichenbach's View)

    - All contingent beings depend on something else for its existence

- Intuition Behind All Cosmological Arguments

  - Something cannot come from nothing

- Types of Explanations

  - Personal Explanation

    - Explanation based on intentions of an agent

    - If free will exists, then not everything is reducible to scientific explanation

  - Scientific Explanation

    - Brute physical processes as explaining an event/process

    - If determinism is true, then there are no truly "personal explanation"

- Advantage of Personal Explanations

  - Reichenbach's View

    - Scientific explanations of the universe's origin will always be incomplete

      - Principle of Causation (Personal rather than the scientific view of Principle of Sufficient Reason)

- Conclusion

  - Necessary being intentionally created contingent beings

- Objections to Cosmological

  - The Universe just is

  - Only need to explain the parts of the universe, not the whole

  - The conclusion of the cosmological argument is contradictory

  - All explanations start from brute, unintelligible facts

  - The cosmological argument is just a version of the ontological argument

    - Religion becomes unnecessary

 

 

Raynor Johnson - "Preexistence, Reincarnation, and Karma"

 

 

John Hick - "Resurrection"

- Continuity of Identity

  - Physical body in Heaven

    - Replica Example

      - Dead body in location A, exact replica in location B

    - Easier to accept as the same person than spirituality

      - Personal Identity might be essentially connected to physical circumstance

- Need for Resurrection

  - God creates finite beings to live in fellowship with him

    - Must have an afterlife so that the finite beings can fulfill their purpose to God

 

 

Grace Jantzen - "Do We Need Immortality?"

- Fulfilling Life without Immortality

  - Fulfillment is the making of significant choices

    - A finite life leads to more fulfilling/significant decisions due to limited time to make them

- Response to Helen Oppenheimer

  - Helen Oppenheimer

    - Unthinkable that a loving God would allow humans to stop existing upon their death

  - Grace Jantzen

    - God allows many precious things to stop existing after their death

      - God notices/mourns(?) your death

 

 

Pascal Boyer - "Why is Religion About Death?"

- Background on the Modularity of the Mind

  - The mind is to some extent relies on modular processes

    - There is little or no conscious control of the process

    - The process happens quickly

    - The process normally emerges at a particular stage of human cognitive development

    - There are "breakdown patterns" - cases where the process malfunctions/doesn't work that show that there is some process occurring

      - People who can't recognize faces

      - People who cannot recognize voices

  - Evolutionary psychologists believe modules operate even at high levels of cognition/mental activity

  - Boyer recognizes:

    - Contagion System

      - System for dealing with dangers that cannot be directly detected

        - Any contact can transmit the invisible containment/pollution

        - The dose of contaminant is irrelevant

      - The "untouchable caste" in Hindu society

    - Intuitive Psychology System

      - System for modeling how another person views a situation

    - Animacy System

      - System that deals with objects that move in a purposeful manner

    - Person-File System

      - System that tracks who is a member of one's own social group(s)

    - Face Recognition System

      - System that recognizes faces rather than just perceiving a generic object

    - Voice Recognition System

      - System that recognizes a voice as from a particular person rather than just generic sounds

- Religions as Terror-Management

  - Many religious outlooks on death are not comforting

- Double Funerals

  - They show that the passage from life is more meaningful than an afterlife

    - Transitionary Period

      - Analogy to other rites of passage

        - Coming of age

        - Marriage

    - Memory of dead person becomes more generic (spiritual force)

      - Talk through decisions as if they were there

    - Also some connection to Contagion System

- Corpses cause Cognitive Dissociation

  - Cognitive Dissociation

    - Inconsistency with your mind

  - Different parts of the mind engage with death

    - Engage animacy system (it's dead) but also person-file system (they're dead)

 

 

David Eagleman Stories about Afterlife

- Two interpretations:

  - Literal depiction of what your afterlife might be

  - Use the story to reflect on your own mortal life

    - Might it change the way you live your life?
