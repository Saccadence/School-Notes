# The Fundamental Terms of Philosophy
## The Three Branches
##### Metaphysics
The study of the most *general features* of reality
- What is the most basic nature of the universe?
Term coined by Aristotle
- Literally means: "beyond/after" physics (what is happening)
###### General Topics
- Existence
- Time
- Causation
- Cosmology
##### Epistemology
The study of knowledge
- How is opinion different from knowledge? How do we obtain knowledge?
Term "episteme" coined by Plato
- Means knowledge; contrasted with *doxa* (opinion)
###### General Topics
Nature of Knowledge
Scope of Knowledge
Acquisition of Knowledge
Justification of Knowledge
##### Ethics
Study of the *best* way to live
- How can "I" improve my life? Is there a best way of living?
Greek word "ethos" means customs or habit
###### General Topics
Meta-ethics
Normative Ethics
Applied Ethics
# Scholasticism to Modern Science
## Scholasticism
### Rediscovery of Aristotle and other Ancient Philosophers
- Most of Aristotle's works had been translated into Latin by 1200s CE
- St. Thomas Aquinas synthesizes Aristotle with Catholic teachings *1200s*
- Scholasticism
	- General term for Aristotelian-Catholic philosophy
### Galileo Galilei, René Descartes, and others challenge Scholasticism
- Rise of "corpuscular"/mechanical philosophy
- New mathematical tools and technologies reinvigorate ancient idea of "atoms"
- Search for right "method" to study nature, emergence of modern "science"
## Primary Qualities versus Secondary Qualities
### Primary Quality
Property of the object itself, independent of observer
### Secondary Quality
Property that only exists as relationship between object and observer
## Two Ancient Classifications of (Basic) Elements of Physical Reality
### Aristotle's Elements
Water, Earth, Air, Fire, and 5th Essence
- 5th Essence - Aether/Quintessence which is found in the universe beyond the *terrestrial sphere*
	- Sometimes mistaken as fire (nebulae in telescopes? - not sure of the power of telescopes of the time)
### Ancient Chinese Phases (*wuxing*)
Wood, Fire, Soil, Metal, Water
## Gap Between Basic Physical Reality and Sensation
- Invention of Microscope - *1500s*
- Invention of Telescope - *1608*
- Galileo (and Descartes) on heat - *1623*
- Germ Theory of Disease - *1850s*
## Rationalism and Empiricism to Transcendental Idealism
An attempt to combine reason and sense experience and the synthetization into a singular idea (a potentially more pragmatic idea)
### Rationalism
- René Descartes
- Baruch Spinoza
- Gottfried Leibniz
### Empiricists
- John Locke
- George Berkeley
- David Hume
### Transcendental Idealism
- Immanuel Kant
# Descartes' Fundamental Philosophy - Mind/Body & Knowledge
## Core Idea
The sensory experience is the main, and only real measure, of usable data that humans have. However, this is a fallible and easy to misuse experience as there is no verifiable way to turn the sensory experience by itself in objective knowledge.
- Brought up later, there is also question of whether our sensory experience has all the tools necessary to achieve the full range of what is capable in our universe.
### Michel de Montaigne - *Apology for Raymond Sebond* (1580-88)
#### Importance of the human senses? Relationship between the sense and knowledge?
The human sensory experience is important as it give us a foundational basis of individual knowledge to be active and capable in the world. 
**However, this sensory experience cannot be attributed to an objective knowledge of the world.**
##### Fallibility of the Sensory Experience - Internal (Mind) and External (Animals)
There is no way to be sure that what we experience is true to reality (e.g. false color perception)
- Furthermore, we may not have access to the full range of possible sensory experience in the world and we may be missing out on some key experience that would provide us a better understanding of the objective reality of the world we inhabit
	- There is also no way for us to be able to tell that we are able missing some sensory experience
		- Could potentially figure out we are missing something by observing another animal, or thing with a sensory experience, doing something that doesn't seem to align with our sensory experience (e.g. better vision, more colors, better sound perception, etc.)
- Our sensory experience can be tricked and told there is something happening that is not happening in reality (e.g. hallucinations, blindness, deafness, etc.)
	- Makes it difficult to trust our own current sensory experience as we cannot be entirely sure that what we are experiencing aligns the most possible with objective reality
		- Mass fallibility among humanity (seen more prevalently with *Francis Bacon*)
#### Relationship between reason and our senses?
Reason can also trick our sensory experience
- We can use our mind to distort some sensory experience through reason
#### What can humans know?
They can know their own experience through their senses and knowledge of things outside of our sensory experience through *faith*
- Faith is qualitatively different than anything else in relation to knowledge and the standard sensory experience. It is a non-physical sensory experience that can be influenced by whatever the non-physical thing you have faith in is.
### Francis Bacon - *New Organon, Book 1* (1620)
#### Knowledge and Power
Need instrumentation to obtain some sense of knowledge through a sensory experience
- Knowledge in this sense becomes power as one understands their sensory limitations and that understanding and working from that framework provides the necessary foundation to be able to command nature (power)
##### Proper Method for Discovering Truth
Gradual induction, moving from sense particulars gradually up to more general claims
- Start with the individual ideas to work backwards to a more foundational understanding of the world and knowledge of the world
### Galileo Galilei - *The Assayer* (1623)
#### What is heat versus the common conception of heat?
The common conception of it is something that is hot as in the direct representation of temperature. However, the real representation of heat relies more on the notion of atoms colliding together in an act that transfer energy from one to the other. The more energy that is transferred from atoms around us into our sensory organs, the "hotter" it feels to us and, by proxy, the higher the temperature is.
##### What "excites" our sensitive body?
Atoms, in general, are what excite our senses in our body.  They can excite our body in the way that atoms interact with us in regards to heat; however, things like taste and smell are solely defined and interacted with by the size, shape, and speed of atoms
### René Descartes' - *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641)
#### Lack of sound demonstrations in philosophy
Arguments in philosophy are often believed to be argued from both sides
- No way to make a sound demonstration similar to those in the fields of math and science
	- These demonstrations would have some sense of truth to them that would be undeniable - "soundness"
- Such a view, whether idealistic or one exhibited in practice, makes philosophy struggle to have any arguments that would have some level of soundness to them as you may never land on one common understanding
	- It would always be argued and each argument would often seem just as sound as the original claim
#### What is necessary to understand Descartes' argument in the *Meditations*
One needs to give up their dogma of their sensory experience and be willing to approach the argument not as fact, but rather as a way of thinking and taking a serious look into an alternative perspective without a sensory experience as being the core of the factual basis.
#### Three Levels of Doubt in *Meditation I*
- Insanity
	- Sensory experience is so deceptive so much that my understanding of my reality is highly incongruent
- Sleep
	- Something we all do and something that is more probably/realistic than insanity
- Evil Genius - Unrelenting Doubt of Everything External (Senses)
	- Supremely power and evil deceiver that makes us believe we have things like our body or the world around us (math, geometry, art, etc.) even though we don't
		- What can we know if this is the case?
##### Universal Simples
Something that we can call upon that regardless of our state there are things that are held in common
- Things such as color and math wherein the colors don't change based on whether we are asleep or awake
##### Why does Descartes imagine the existence of an "evil genius"
The use of the existence of an "evil genius" is one that is designed to allow for the complete questioning of even things like Universal Simples
- Descartes keeps running back into his long-standing beliefs that are "corrupting" his ability to doubt completely and figure out what is without doubt that he can build from
#### The First Cartesian Truth
As long as I'm thinking, I exist
- The evil genius is a deceiver and to deceive someone there need to be someone to deceive
	- It is necessary I exist to be deceived
#### The Wax Example
Wax is wax regardless of it's physical properties shifting and changing
- There is some definitive shift in the totality of what it is to be wax (touch, smell, etc.), regardless it is wax though
- A definitive perception, in a purely conceptual manner, would be something that is fundamental to any given object
#### The Proof for God (and it's reason)
God is used to address the issue of the Evil Genius and to allow for him to begin to build towards the idea of the material world and the conception of the body/senses
##### Descartes' Cosmological Argument
In order to have an idea of a God (infinite being), there needs to be such a being to have given the notion to a finite being, unless we ourselves are infinite beings (which he argues is not the case due to human error)
#### Human Error
We have a limited knowledge, but we can avoid error as long as we take more time to examine our beliefs due to such a limited/finite knowledge
- Error is an overextension of the will in soliciting a proper judgement
#### What is the purpose of human perception/pleasures and pains?
Perception and pleasure/pain exist to direct the body to do or avoid certain things
- The mind is affected by these things that affect the human body
- Perception is a reflection of things that could potentially affect us (pleasure and pain)
##### Analogy between body-mind and ship-sailor
The body-mind is far more interconnected than a ship-sailor. The body-mind dynamic is significantly more unique than that of a sailor in the sense that the mind is directly, "personally," more affected by the pains/pleasures of the body; while the sailor only experiences things, "personally," through the perception (intellectually) of a direct interaction of the ship.
- The mind perceives direct interaction with the body through sensory information (not purely intellectual)
- The sailor perceives direct interaction with the ship through visual information alone (purely intellectual)
#### Elisabeth and Descartes
##### How does the mind interact/control the body?
Elisabeth
- How can an immaterial thing affect a material thing?
Descartes
- The mind and body are uniquely connected in such a manner that is inconceivable to one another. Each is only known to itself and their interaction is complicated and unknowable to each other.
	- The interaction between the two is similar to that of gravity (heaviness) in the sense of immaterial affecting material things
### Nicolas Malebranche - *The Search after Truth* (1674-1675)
#### How do we perceive things outside the mind?
- Objects transmit species resembling them
- Mind produces ideas of objects when encountering the objects
- God places all ideas in our mind or at each moment in mind that we need
- Mind sees essence of objects by considering its own perfection
- Mind sees all things in God
##### What are the four ways of knowing something?
###### Know by themselves
Things, like God, are only knowable by things similar to them.
- God is the only such being and therefore only knowable by himself
###### Know them through ideas
Conceptions of things through reason and/or experience
###### Know through consciousness (internal awareness)
Things that are only present through self-experience
###### Know them through conjecture
Taking of self-experience and/or ideas and applying to other things that may or may not have it be a property of it
#### Occasionalism
No true power to will things (move, create, destroy) by finite beings
- All true power is found in an infinite being(s)
	- To have a true power for one thing is to have true power for all things (i.e. be an infinite being)
##### Natural Causes
Something that causes God to act in a particular way and situation
- The thing causes physical modification through our sensory experience is only the perceptual notion of the cause
	- We are unaware of true cause through sensory experience but through reason we can discern the real reason to be through God
#### Free Will
God draws people to the *good* and therefore, although we can act freely towards the end that we consider good, God pulls us to his conception of good
- To be able to will to do something, God needs to have willed the being to be able to do the things they freely will
##### Error/Sin
A mistake in the priority of things that we should love
### Thomas Hobbes - *Leviathan* (1651)
#### Gripe with Aristotle, and other Institutions around Supernatural
The philosophy of Aristotle, and similar thoughts (like body and blood of Christ through wine and crackers), scare the general populace away from following the ideas of the government (sovereign) as they won't turn to the government for help as much, making government weaker.
- Social contract and reason are the most important part of society as they help protect individuals and give people true security
- Pull away from virtues (Aristotle) and focus on good/evil (pleasure/pain) and justice (derived from punishment for breaking of social contract)
#### Mind/Body
##### Sensory Experience
The direct *pressure* of objects on our body through interaction of the nerves
- Immediate
	- Touch and Taste
- Mediately
	- Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling
Sense experience is derived from the most prominent source
- As we take in more sensory information, past sensory experience begins to be *overwritten* and pushed into the background
###### Imagination
The recall of past sensory experience into the forefront of our mind
- The more it's buried, the more fuzzy it is
###### Dreaming
Effectively the same as imagination but tends to be more absurd and incongruent with our experience during the collection of the sensory information that we gathered to create the dream
- Finds it to be an effective response to the idea of Descartes' dream skepticism
##### Knowledge
How do we know things and what way can we incorporate sensory information
###### Prudence
Past experience as the primary method of predicting the future
###### Reason
The combination of past experience and mental reasoning (proper use of language/definitions in the correct order to create a prediction)
- Reckoning (add/subtract) of consequents (from antecedents) 
### Anne Conway - *The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy* (1692)
#### What is the Body and Soul?
They both come from the same substance and origin
##### Body
A concentrated and stable substance that is made up of a potential to become any soul (things including rocks as well)
##### Soul
A subtle and unstable substance that is within the concentrated and stable substance (typically more or less of the same substance)
# Free Will/Determinism - The Nature of the Universe
## Core Idea
What exactly governs the world? Do things have the ability to act on their own and create their own causal events regardless of previous causal events that have happened in their, or the object(s)/being(s) they interact with.
- If Free Will exists, what exactly is freedom and how is it used?
- If Determinism exists, how do we understand the world and exist within it without completely giving into the idea that all actions are "determined"
	- To clarify, determinism relies on the idea that causal chains create every outcome and are predictable. Although we appear to make choices, and we should continue to take that worldview in our analysis of self and others, we should acknowledge that causal chains are the reason(s) for our actions and we need to take the mental disposition of seeing past actions and working to affect the future causal chains that would otherwise recreate the causal change that happened before.
### Baruch Spinoza - *Ethics* Part II: *"Nature and Origin of the Mind"*
#### God's Power and Human Power
##### God's Power
God is the necessary action of the universe
- Eternal truth and the complete substance of everything
- Avoid anthropomorphizing God as it is completely wrong to do so since they are not a being but rather the eternal truth which makes up the *infinite* substance of the universe
	- Literally everywhere in contrast to the modern conceptions of God as a being that walks among man
##### Human Power
Can't fully make decisions because actions are necessarily determined
- Our mind/conception of the world leads to the logical fallacy, which is the basis of our understanding of what Free Will is: *post hoc ergo hoc* Fallacy
	- Our hindsight/review of things that happened lead to our conception of what happened in the moment, even though:
		- **1)** We cannot know this to be the case necessarily
		- **2)** We don't have that power (Only *God* does)
		- **3)** There is no discernable way to properly self-assess what happens in the moment as the moment is constantly passing we are incapable of assessing it in time
			- **a)** We could potentially assess this with external tools with hindsight, but there is no guarantee of this possibility and whether we can even properly assess the nature of the thing we're observing
		- **4)** We lack the ability to comprehend - even *if* we could know - everything, or even most things, as concepts such as the infinite are impossible to comprehend as finite beings
#### Epistemic Information
##### Intuition
Proceeds from adequate knowledge of attributes of God and knowledge of things
- This knowledge allows us to create conceptions/undestandings of things quickly and roughly
	- This knowledge can be wrong but it's important that it's more background processing/output than conscious and detailed thinking processes
	- In math, this can be see in questions like 2+2, 6/2, etc. where math is an eternal truth and our ability to know the answers to the *manipulation* of those eternal truths into an output of some kind comes from a more subconscious - *intuitive* - process
##### Suspension of Disbelief
The introduction/consideration of contrasting ideas to one's belief(s)
- Notably **NOT** the determined willing of said *suspension of disbelief*
#### Practical Advantages
**1)** We all act on God's Will
**2)** Can more easily endure pleasure and pain
**3)** Easier to avoid hating others
**4)** Better teaches how to properly treat others due to it not being an account of one's free will/decisions, but rather the causal chain that led to their existence and their situation
### Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - *Discourse on Metaphysics* (1686)
#### Nature of God and the Universe
Both are a collection of perfections, however God is the most perfect collection of **all** perfections where all of them exist within God in such a manner that God has perfect knowledge of everything
##### Understanding God
Can only be understood through the examination perfections (like knowledge and power)
#### Past, Present, Future
God knows the sequence of events of the world, i.e. they are predetermined, but we should strive to be content with our past and aim for making the future as good as possible instead of just waiting for "God's Will"
#### Concept of Freedom
##### Necessary Truths
Principle of non-contradiction
### Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - *Monadology* (1714) and *Letters to Samuel Clarke* (1715-1716)
### M. de Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet) - *Candide* (1759)
A fictional work that is a satirization of the thoughts and works of philosophers/metaphysicians who largely believe that we exist in the "best possible world" since God chose this world to be the one that we live in.
#### Main Characters - Who They Are and What They Represent
##### Candide
A person that lives under the guise of free will in an ordered/structured and/or pre-determined world and is highly impressionable by those around him (namely Pangloss)
##### Pangloss
A stand-in for, nearly 1:1, Leibniz and his overall philosophy regarding the nature of the universe and how to interpret and a potential actor within that worldview
- This character is largely probably there to show those that agree with Leibniz the absurdity of the viewpoint when followed in a more strict sense and not and modified, actionable version of it. Essentially an idealistic rendition of the metaphysical structure.
##### Cunégonde
