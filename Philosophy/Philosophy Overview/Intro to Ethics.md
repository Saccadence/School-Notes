    - Socrates response

      - Should only care about "greatest good" (wisdom) and "greatest evil" (foolishness)

      - The opinions of others have an impact on current conditions in scenarios, however, they are not the most important things

# Richard Taylor - "Good and Evil"

- Overview of Taylor's Ethics

  - What ought to be is derived from what is

    - Will drives Reason

- Conative Beings

  - Wants, needs, intention

    - Metabolizing beings

    - Non-living organisms have intention?

      - No

      - Taylor emphasizes social cooperation, however, so not important to the point

 

 

# Steven Cahn - "God and Morality"

- Dilemma: Can morality emerge from God

  - Cahn: No

- Implanted Moral Principles from God?

  - Probably not because it conflicts with intuitions of people

  - Disagreements among people about what is morally correct

  - Popular opinion could be a way for God to test an individual's courage

- Ways to destroy divine creations?

  - Death is natural

    - Are we assisting God by killing people?

  - Made with capacity to murder?

    - Are we doing something wrong by not fulfilling that potential?

      - Best response is that it is a test from god

- One true record of God commands?

  - Is it wrong/right because God said so or did God say it because it is right/wrong?

- To be moral is to act without fear of punishment, might doesn't make right

James Rachels - "The Challenge of Cultural Relativism"

- Arguments against Relativism

  - Invalid Argument Pattern

    - Just because there is disagreement doesn't mean that there is no object moral values

  - Bad Consequences if True

    - The notion of moral progress would be doubtful

    - It is impossible to judge another society's morals as inferior to our own

  - Less Value Difference than it Seems

  - Three Common Values

- Lessons from Cultural Relativism

# Immanuel Kant - "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals"

- Only Unqualified Good

  - Good Will

    - Morally good intentions

      - Road to hell paved with good intentions

    - Need a way to test good intentions

      - Use notion of categorical imperative

- Relationship Between Happiness and Morality

  - Happiness

    - Power, wealth, honor, health, and that complete well-being and contentment with one's state

      - Individual satisfaction with actions

    - Happiness is important because it decreases the likelihood of following imperatives over duties

      - Happiness is a secondary duty

    - Only morally good people deserve to be happy

- Two Types of Imperative

  - Hypothetical

    - An action is good for some purpose or other, either possible or actual

    - Example:

      - Donate to charity for some personal benefit

        - Political

        - Reputation

        - Tax Write-off

  - Categorical

    - An action that is good in of itself

      - Example:

        - Donating to someone

          - With intentions that are not self-interested

    - Better to be satisfied and be a pig (ignorant) than to be Socrates (informed/wise) and dissatisfied

  - Weak Will, Embittered Person

    - Integrity issues with morality

  - Too High a Standard

    - There is a difference between a standard for action and the motives following it

      - "99% of actions not necessarily for greater good; okay if not going against the greater good"

- The Nature of Happiness

# John Rawls - "A Theory of Justice"
## The Original Position of Equality
- ### A hypothetical built to discern the foundational ethical principles of equality and justice
	- #### An individual does not know his:
		- Intelligence or any other natural talents
		- Class position or social status in a society
		- Specific psychological dispositions
	- Mentions that one should give up their Concept of Good
		- Distinction between:
			- #### Concept of Good
				- Positive thing(s) for one's life
					- Money
					- Socializing
					- Entertainment
			- #### Sense of Right/Wrong
				- All Basic Liberties
					- Freedom of Speech
					- Freedom of Assembly
					- Freedom of Person
					- Freedom from Arbitrary Arrest and Seizure
						- More of a Liberalism-esque position
				- Rights that one would agree with - regardless of whether one should exercise these rights or not
					- Within the bounds of the thought experiment, you have the potential to be one of those people
	- Built in such a way that the most important person we consider is the most disadvantaged person
		- Possible for you to be that person
		- ### "Maxi-Min Reasoning"
			- Built from the ideas of the Rational Choice Theory
				- Maximize the minimum outcome
- Conclusion that comes up is the Principles of Justice
	- A quasi-objective ethical framework to maximize justice/equality
## The Principles of Justice
- Equality of basic rights and duties
- Social inequalities are only justifiable when they benefit everyone
	- Things like affordable:
		- Medical Care
		- Quality Education
		- Housing





# Iris Marion Young - "Political Responsibility and Structural Injustice"
## Definition of Structural Injustice
- ### Too complex to trace how individual actions cause the unjust outcome
	- An individual doesn't necessarily have the capability to know/understand the impact they have on the overall systemic injustice they are taking part in
## Political Responsibility
- ### Political Responsibility Model
	- Focus on baseline norms
		- Seek out norms that are pushing the systemic injustice forward rather than suppressing it
	- Does not seek to identify individuals to be held responsible
		- Looking to specific (powerful) individuals is more backward looking
	- More forward looking
		- We need to look more to the future ways to resolve systemic injustice
## Degree of Political Responsibility
- Everyone is responsible for everything however, certain individuals have greater degrees of culpability
	- Political leaders and system leaders have the greatest degree of responsibility due to privilege, power, and connection
	- Non-voting, disadvantaged, and no connection to the system have the lowest degree of responsibility
# Michael Sandel - "The Case against Perfection"
#### Sandel's Conclusion
- Giving people superpowers would be an issue
- Enhancements threaten to banish our appreciation for the gift of life
- The concept of mastery would be lost if enhancements would become used widespread for non-compensatory reasons
##### Sandel's Objection
- Hyperagency
	- Seeking too much control
- Bad character disposition
	- Too prideful (like Prometheus)
	- In comparison to the idea of the Giftedness of Life
- Virtue Ethics Perspective
## Oppose "Better-than-Real" Enhancements
#### Compensatory Enhancements
- Main idea is to only treat issues
	- Going beyond is to make "better-than-real" enhancements and is not a valuable or ethical process
## Giftedness of Life
### Moral Implications of Humility
- Keep an open mind to things that we did not ask for
	- "The more alive we are to the chanced nature of our lot, the more reason we have to share our fate with others..."
# Francis Kamm - "Is There a Problem with Enhancement"
#### Kamm's Conclusion
- Consequentialist perspective
	- Motives are less important than results
- Sandel is a consequentialist about illness so why does he stop there
## Main Criticisms of Sandel
### Results are more Morally Important
- Consequentialist
	- Motives don't necessarily matter if the outcomes are desirable for improvement
	- Also uses some Kantian/Ethics of Care reasoning
## Treatments vs. Enhancements
## Right to Social Assistance
### Should we ensure a moral right to social assistance?
- People are intrinsically valuable
	- Kantian Ethics: Value of Autonomy
	- Ethics of Care: Relational Identity
## Lack of Imagination Danger
# Biomedical Discussion
## Survey Question in Class
### Select all of the below enhancements that you think a parent should be able to seek in their prospective child?
| Issue                    | Yes | Uncertain | No  |
|:------------------------ |:---:|:---------:|:---:|
| Increased Height         |  3  |     5     |  0  |
| Hair or Eye Color        |  5  |     2     |  1  |
| Intelligence             |  3  |     3     |  2  |
| More Altruism            |  3  |     3     |  2  |
| More Monogamy            |  0  |     2     |  6  |
| Avoid Muscular Dystrophy |  6  |     1     |  0  |
| Avoid Dwarfism           |  5  |     1     |  1  |
| Avoid Deafness           |  7  |     0     |  1  |
##### Does your answer change if you are able to make the change as an adult?
## In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
### Dwarfism
- Used IVF to control for double dominant genes that would make their child's life very short
	- Why should people care about what other people do? - Libertarian ideal
- Brings up some aspects of Ableism
##### Personal Question:
- Assuming everyone has equal access to this gene editing (for issues not limited to dwarfism such as deafness), why should this be a limiting factor?
	- If we can remove a whole impairment, why should the community of people who have adapted and learned to live with these impairments?
		- These communities are not necessarily ones built on the back of some cultural issue but rather they are built on the backs of a genetic mutation that has caused them to have to adapt to the way of life of the majority who live without the genetic mutation.
# Nick Bostrom - "Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies"
## The Control Problem
- Overall, how to control what a superintelligent agent would do
### Fable of the Sparrows
- Sparrows wanted to get an owl egg to raise an owl to work for them but there was no knowledge of how to or if the owl would even do so
### Only one chance to solve?
- If a superintelligent being was to be present, we would only have one chance to please it before it would decide we weren't worthy of respectable consideration
	- Ensure that if we were to make a superintelligence they would align with our values or would work with us, otherwise, once it's out in the open (if it's AI), we wouldn't be able to change it's preferences
		- "The Treacherous Turn"
## Long-term Impact of Human Level Machine Intelligence
- Once the intelligence of the machine can achieve HLMI/AGI, there would not necessarily be a stopping point for the AI
	- AI is much faster at learning and training mastery once it has begun to understand the concept of the problem at hand
		- Emotions are not a factor and it can think in complete logic terms at immense speeds and stamina
### Human Level Machine Intelligence (HLMI) or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- The ability of the AI to match the capabilities of human-level problem solving skills and/or detection of objects in the world
	- Things that are relatively trivial for us in terms of understanding and/or mastering
		- Some AIs have advanced to surpass humans in logic skills for certain tasks such as board games like Chess or Go; however, it struggles to comprehend and understand what objects are in the world through images/videos
## Default Outcome Doom?
### Orthogonality Thesis
### Instrumental Convergence Thesis
## Bostrom's Indirect Path Forward
- Focus on solving the control problem before/alongside the development of AI
	- Then we can use AI to help us answer the questions of the universe/ourselves
### Danger of an AI Safety Winter
