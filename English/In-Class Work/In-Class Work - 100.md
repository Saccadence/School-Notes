> Alex Tabbarok - The Case for Getting Rid of Borders
>
>  

- What is the main point?

  - To convince people to advocate for the removal of borders

- How does he support this point?

  - Rhetoric

    - Ethos

      - Rousseau - "Man is born free"

      - Articles and data

    - Pathos

      - Freedom

      - Borders and countries within them compound injustice, inequality, discrimination, and bigotry

      - Immigration is squashed by lawmakers and heads of state w/ state-sanctioned violence???

        - Forced repatriation

        - Involuntary, detention, or worse

          - Appealing to targeted audience's imagination and hatred towards centralized government

>  

- Logos

  - Wage differences - Immigrants from poor countries double, triple, or ten-fold income

  - Open borders would double GDP

  - Increased labor force of 1% would outnumber economic value of all migrants under foreign aid

>  

- What is my opinion on it?

  - This is insane due to not fully based in reality and built on a fundamental idea that government along with borders is the main reason for the poor moralization of society and global economic downshift. No attempt to reach anyone that already didn’t agree.

> What do you consider to be effective rhetoric?

- What do you consider to be effective rhetoric? In other words, what would one need to do to convince you of something?

  - Effective rhetoric is rhetoric that doesn't use emotion and authority to run away from flawed logic. A person who argues with sound logic that can be followed and, while it can be disputed, makes a point with solid foundations and a sound conclusion. The use of emotion and authority are not explicitly bad rhetoric but the over uses of them show that they don't have a solid basis to any of their claims, especially those that claim to be prescriptive. In order to convince me of one's belief, there has to be a logical argument I can follow and dispute where I see fit and uses authority and emotion to make those logical claims stronger. In the event that a topic being argued does not have a lot of data to back it up, using a healthy amount of life and/or professional experience can be a good way to make a claim stronger without completely losing me in their perspective.

    - \$329 million of resell profit from Nike shoes alone

  - Sketchers is \#2, passing Adidas

    - Net income is \$209 million

  - Nike customers is making almost double Sketchers sales

> What are your goals for Eng 100?
>
> To learn how to better format my thoughts and opinions in a more concise and persuasive way in which that I can engage in complex topics without losing the people I am talking to while also being able to share my full opinion.
>
>  
>
> What do you believe a class like Eng 100 should instill?
>
> I think Eng 100 should teach people the basics of effective communication through a more standardize form of English that does not give way to dialects within one's work. English is a complex language and teaching people to use a more standard and/or formal version of the language can allow them to better communicate with people who may not be as well versed in the nuances of a specific dialect.

> How do you foresee a class that focuses on reading, writing, etc. interacting with your future goals?
>
> I see myself as someone who can become academically well versed in whatever area I want to pursue and being able to read and express my opinions within the academic setting is one that I hold great importance to. Outside of academics I am very interested in politics both within the government and within society. Being able to know, understand, and use effective communication skills can allow to engage with these areas in a nuanced manner and allow me to speak to other people who can help me progress individually in those fields.

- Coates - Why I'm Writing Captain America

  - Engaging in a new way of thinking, others' worldview and strong opinions

  - Seeing what "The Dream" supposedly is

  - Telling a new and more interesting perspective on the story of Captain America that is devoid of the repetitive nature of expressing one's opinions over and over again

  - Captain America has been removed from the propaganda of America and now attached to "The Dream" of America, expanding on this thought and seeing the progression of how that way of thinking impacts Captain America

  - Difficult to achieve as it strays from making strong opinion pieces that come from the self to expressing someone else's opinion visually and written, in a way that accurately represents them, devoid of personal opinions

- Excerpt \#1 - Stop 'I Spy' Game With Allies

  - America is going against the original intention of gathering intelligence in the name of policing other countries and everyone else does it so why can't we

  - Distracts from the main reason for doing it in the first place of fighting terrorism

  - Shows reasons why the reasoning from the NSA are not sound and almost petty to prove that the overall point of fighting terrorism has been undermined

- Excerpt \#2 - The War On Drugs

  - The war on drugs is fruitless, and inefficient because you'll never be able to plug the hole of supply when the demand is so high

  - Explains the reason for the beginning of America's original "war on drugs" and explains how they never learned from the past and how it has grown far beyond the original scope of what they were trying to achieve

  - Shows how previous issues listed compound into bigger ones that make the original intentions are deprecated
