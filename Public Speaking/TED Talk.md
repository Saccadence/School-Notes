# Anxiety is our
most powerful tool, and our greatest enemy.
# We evolved in a way that
we could sense danger before there was even danger present.
# However, this trait has
found less usage as the danger we are faced with in America consistently is not imminent mortal harm.
# Anxiety, as defined in
2011 by Bateson et al. in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, is a combination of the probability of a negative outcome and the vulnerability of ourselves when that outcome occurs.
# We weigh these potentials
to form a reaction and take preventative measures against whatever the perceived threat is.
# These can range from
potential violent acts to social situations.
# Advancements in society
has shifted the "imminent mortal harm" from physical violence to social situations such as interacting with others or public speaking.
# --------------------------------------------------------
# In life,
we are faced with many of these potential harms.
# They can be
external, internal, or both.
# We can either
evaluate the real and present danger in front of us, or we evaluate the hypothetical world and scenario we've made in our head.
# Making decisions on these scenarios
comes from looking at the outcomes and then weighing the pros and cons of each, which anxiety plays a role in.
# However, for many people -
such as myself - the anxiety becomes more of a wall.
# A wall
made of fear and pride.
# It causes us to fear the
unknown and let our pride take control because of the potential for failure or being shamed for our work.
# This wall only exists
in our mind however and learning that is the most important step to being more decisive and doing the things you want.

# Many celebrities and public figures
who we perceive as being successful or confident aren't immune to anxiety.
# Written on Forbes' website
by Lipi Roy in 2021, celebrities such as Ryan Reynolds have spoken about their struggles with anxiety and mental health in general.
# These are people who acknowledge
their anxieties, or other mental health issues, and they work alongside them.
# Learning to harness
the power of seeing the future with your anxiety for good, rather than letting it slow you down, is a difficult step but one of the most impactful ones.
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# I've spent most of my life
fighting my anxiety and thinking it was holding me back, but the reality is that that it's not necessarily bad and it can be useful.
# It just takes learning
when to use it and, more importantly, how to use it.
# To this day, I struggle
to believe I am good enough to do well in something that I then turn around and succeed in later.
# I never feel prepared enough
or feel confident enough, even with all the proper preparation.
# The reality is that
just getting up and doing it is the secret.
# I felt better
and more productive once I figured that out.
# Although I am still scared
to do a lot of things, which I'm actively working on, that mentality has helped me to work harder with more of the things that I want to do and learn.
# Other people's perception
of you or the grade you get when the outcome happens doesn't necessarily matter, although they can be important.
# What matters is the lesson
you learned from your experience: you can do it.
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# If you mess up,
that's alright because you'll do better next time.
# Nothing can be worse than
that first time you attempt something.
# It might suck
or it might go really well; however, improvement only comes through practice and learning what doesn't work.
# Trying to figure out
what works immediately is the approach that keeps you from doing the things you want.
# Some people might
get lucky and stumble into the right answer or be really smart and figure out the best method quickly, but even those people are learning from the past mistakes of either themselves or others.
# The important part
is that no matter what: you try and then you make sure you gain some new knowledge from the experience.
# It's even more important to remember
that in order to step down from something, you must first take that initial step up.
# You'll never know what
the top is like if you spend your whole life staring at it from the bottom watching everyone else go up.
