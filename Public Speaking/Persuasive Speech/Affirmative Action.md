# Affirmative action has been around
since the 1960s as an informal policy by President John F. Kennedy.
# This policy has been
on the minds of many Americans - specifically students -  as it recently got struck down by the Supreme Court in June of 2023.
# However, the decision to
strike down race-based affirmative action in college admissions has been coming for a long time and in some states, including California, it was struck down decades ago.
# The problem is that
**Affirmative Action, as a policy, fails to holistically help minority students in competitive colleges due to a misplaced emphasis on racially based admission improvements.**
# On average, disadvantaged minority students
come from worse educational backgrounds where attending these competitive colleges is not a viable decision.
# This is because they were
never properly prepared, nor had the support structure necessary, to succeed.
# The basic idea behind these issues
comes down to two major factors: a lack of consideration by colleges to examine student preparedness with affirmative action, and a lack of a holistic approach to truly help disadvantaged minorities.
# --------------------------------------------------------
# On June 29, 2023, Mark Sherman
of AP News reported on that day, "The Supreme Court...struck down affirmative action in college admissions, declaring race cannot be a factor and forcing institutions of higher education to find new ways to achieve diverse student bodies."
# In the June 29th, 2023 majority opinion
written by Chief Justice Roberts for the Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and University of North Carolina, they state that based on the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision,
### "The decision reached by the Brown court
was unmistakably clear: the right to a public education 'must be made available to all on equal terms.'"
### Furthermore, "The Court reiterated the rule
just one year later, holding that 'full compliance' with Brown required schools to admit students on a 'racially nondiscriminatory basis'"
# The decision by the Supreme Court
is one built on principle and past case law; however, this is not the only reason that affirmative action is a poor policy.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# One of the foundational concepts
is the disparity between disadvantaged minorities and other advantaged students.
# In a 2021 study by Assari et al.
in the Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics journal, they found that in a study of 10th grade students across the US,
### in both suburban and urban schools only, 
where the likelihood of a student being Black doubles in comparison to a suburban one, there was a significant correlation between the student's race and their parent's level of education on student performance.
# Furthermore, in a study conducted in 2007
by Ferguson et al. in the Pediatrics & Child Health journal, they note that poverty is a major risk factor associated with poor educational outcomes.
### Namely, as the severity and the length of poverty increases,
the educational outcomes of young students decrease significantly.
# Overwhelmingly, it has been observed -
and acknowledged - that the external circumstances of students are extremely important for education.
# However, as we'll see,
affirmative action, and the competitive colleges that have historically used it, has led to more underprepared minorities attending these highly competitive educational settings.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# In a study conducted by Arcidiacono et al. in 2023,
which was published in the Journal of Political Economy Microeconomics.
# They found that 75% of African Americans
who applied to Harvard were in the bottom 30% of the academic index - a weighted average of an applicant's high school GPA and SAT scores - whereas only 23% in that range were White.
# However, the more worrisome aspect is that
6% of those same African American applicants were admitted while only 1% of the same White applicants were admitted which is 6 times less likely.
# Furthermore, they found that
10% of all African American applicants were admitted; however, when controlling for racial preferences, that number drops to just 2%.
# These disparities are problematic as,
while it does boost diversity on Harvard campus, the data shows not only a clear lack of proper communication to minority groups about their likelihood to succeed at Harvard, 
### but it also shows
a targeted attempt to recruit more of these disadvantaged minorities.
# -------------------------------------------------------
# This leads to my second main point: the necessity of
a more holistic approach to help disadvantaged minorities.
# In a 2021 paper, written by Whitcomb et al.
in the American Education Research Association journal, women and underrepresented minority students often struggle more with sexism, racism, and/or the general fear of confirming stereotypes in non-diverse learning environments.
# Due to these findings,
we must work to ensure students of all genders and races are able to attend school without feeling pressure or stress outside of their normal schoolwork on campus.
# This is further supported by a 2020 metanalysis
by Barnett in the Perspectives in Education journal.
# Barnett notes that of the 12 articles he covered,
a common theme found was that to achieve diversity, you need to make accommodations by including a diverse group of people in the outcomes of the design process for curriculum and support services.
# Furthermore, there needs to be an effort by the staff
to embody the values of the school through their actions to really sell and incorporate diversity in the student body.
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Finally, consistent with previous findings,
the U.S. Department of Education published a report in September 2023 through their website which called for holistic solutions for diversity following the ban of affirmative action.
# These were actions and goals such as:
- Targeted outreach and pathway programs for K-12
- A better review process to determine student hardship
- The ending of legacy admissions
- Improved affordability
- and Making environments more supportive for students through - on campus
	- Programs
	- Activities
	- and Utilities
# These goals aim to achieve
more long-term, successful diversity, for both universities and students, and increase general student opportunities for success.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# The overall argument presented here today
is that of improved diversity, not through forceful implementation but rather through reforms in the approach of schools, namely competitive colleges, to improve the viability of minority student success.
# As stated in the beginning,
**Affirmative Action, as a policy, fails to holistically help minority students in competitive colleges due to a misplaced emphasis on racially based admission improvements**
# This has been demonstrated through
the data from Harvard regarding their applicants of minority groups, and their much higher admission rates
### despite data showing
and increased risk of these groups not receiving equal, or even proper, education beforehand.
# However, if you were to take one thing
away from this speech, let it be that: Diversity is possible.
# To achieve it, however,
we must ensure that minorities, especially those that are disadvantaged, need to be properly set up for success in any given college they go to.
# Otherwise, we are failing to truly help
those we are aiming to include in these highly competitive colleges.
