# Conceptual Learning Outcomes for the course
#### Hardware and Binary Code
#### Operating System
Controls the physical hardware
#### C++ Coding
#### Interrelation of three former concepts
# Crow
Crows observed a tent and maintained knowledge of how many students were in the tent while the teacher and other students looked on and kept notes on the reactions of the crows. This was to identify the ability of the crows to remember how many students were in the tent based on whether they stayed quiet or not.
- It was repeatedly observed that upon adding a 4th student, the crows would prematurely become noisy on the exiting of the third student, despite one remaining and them never having reacted early before.
	- Shows the crows only retained knowledge of 3 students (objects) entering the tent once they began walking out
	- Points to a "Magic Number" or Memory Span Limit
		- Defined by the mind's focus, or items of which the mind chooses to think about and any one moment
- George Miller (1952) did an experiment with humans and found the "magic number" to be that of 7 +/- 2 items on average
	- ##### My "CROW" is 8
## Infant
Limited sensory information
- Immediate short-range sensory world
## Child
Increased sensory information
- Growing need for "crow"
Combining multiple stimuli into a singular abstract conceptual category
- Easier to manage and keep track of
	- 1st Level Abstraction
### 1st Level Abstraction
##### Volition
Thinking/Concept-formation is not automatic, must be chosen to do
##### Identity
All things have properties
##### Defining
The careful selection of properties to use to create the abstraction
- Ideally, properties that explain the most possible about like objects
##### Summarize
Find a singular word, or concept, to define numerous entities
## Adult
### Concepts from Concepts
Useful to categorize sets of objects with similar properties into a larger, more general, category (chocolate bars -> candy bars -> candy)
#### Conceptual Hierarchy
The bottom are singular entities that exist - top are (one of) the simplest derived concepts for any one set of entities, typically derived from other preexisting concepts used to define either other like concepts or individual entities
- This concept will become "interchangeable" with computing and coding concepts as things are highly connected and often reliant on one another
