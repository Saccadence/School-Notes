# Definitions
### Hardware
Physical components that digitally store data
### Software
Digitally coded instructions on a permanent storage device | copied to temporary storage when in use
### Data
A collection of 0's and 1's that are used to store text/images/etc.
### Information Processing
Consists of Input, Process, Output, and Storage
- Use of data for this process
### Convergence
The taking of 2 or more devices, in function, to one device
## Hardware
### Transistors
Electronic switch that flips from off/on (binary)
### Peripherals
A device that connects to and works with a computer (external or internal)
- Input, Storage, and/or Output
	- Also called Human-Interface Devices (HID)
	- Use Universal Serial Bus (USB) as a method of connection
#### Keyboard
Activation of a switch at an address to signal a symbol to be input
#### Mouse
Tracking of X and Y motion from a physical device to a screen
### Data Sizes
Prefixes for data sizes
- Tera (1 Trillion)
- Giga (1 Billion)
- Mega (1 Million)
- Kilo (1 Thousands)
#### Byte
A sequence of 8 bits
### Process
#### Central Processing Unit
Receives instructions and data from RAM
##### Common Parts of CPU Architecture
- Number of Bits
	- Parallel bit movement
- Speed of Bits
	- How fast bits can be transferred
- Cache
	- Amount of built-in memory in CPU
- Core
	- Number of CPUs on a given chip
		- Can offload work to other cores and speed up data processing
#### Graphical Processing Unit
Dedicated data processing to the monitor
- Sometimes built onto CPU
- Speeds up overall processing by offloading the heavy data processing demands of the monitor
	- Typically designed to better handle the data processing needed (matrix data)
### Output
#### Monitor
Display information visually from GPU
- Screen Size
	- Measured diagonally
- Pixel
	- Made of 3 sub-pixels (red, blue, green)
	- Number of pixels in a row and number of rows make up resolution
		- 2560x1440 is 2560 pixels per row and 1440 rows
- Resolution
	- Image clarity
		- More pixels = more clarity
		- Data can be more finely tuned causing less rough edges (smoother lines)
### Storage
#### Permanent
Data will not be erased (Non-Volatile)
##### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
Metal/Ceramic iron-oxide coated disks that spin and get magnetized to store data physically
##### Solid State Drive (SSD)
Electrically stores data permanently and is typically the fastest data storage transfer rate
##### Flash Drive
Uses similar technology to SSD but much smaller and slower typically
#### Temporary
Data will disappear when powered off and is unrecoverable
- Different from L1 Cache on CPU
##### Random Access Memory (RAM)
Temporary memory
- Amount that can be used on a computer is limited by CPU address size (32 or 64 bit)
