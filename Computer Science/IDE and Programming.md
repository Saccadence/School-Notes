# IDE
**Integrated**
- Implies many parts (windows)
**Development**
- You write, debug, and run code
**Environment**
- Place where it happens
## Starting a Project
### Setup
Install IDE
- Make sure you have C++ installed
	- We'll be using 32 bit
- Start a project with C++ as the language of choice
	- Can be done by starting a project with C++, or creating a file (text file) and saving it with as \[NAME].cpp if the IDE you use doesn't create a project file/folder structure (like Visual Studio Code)
### Coding
Project Start
- Open the project and/or file(s) in the IDE with the *Solution Explorer Window*
- Begin typing in the *Code Window*
	- Any syntax errors in the code will appear in the code window (if available with your IDE)
- Any errors in compilation, or unresolved syntax errors, will appear in the *Error Window*
	- Most common are:
		- Spelling/Syntax Errors
		- Missing Code
		- Extra Code
		- Sequence Errors
	- They'll (typically) tell you what line the error occurred on and what type of error (if detectable)
		- If available in the IDE, it will also tell you what the *expected* code was (i.e. if you forgot a semicolon or likewise)
