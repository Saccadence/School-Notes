# Code - "The Soul of the Machine"
## Physical Things (Units) to Data Codes/Sets
### Data Codes
- Binary/Digital Code - Base 2 (Binary)
	- 0 and 1 denote a "binary" state (off or on, low or high voltage, bubble left or right, etc.)
		- Two states of a thing that are recorded, processed, and transferred
- Analog - *Typically* infinite range of values a thing can express
	- Things like knobs or sliders to control something
	- When expressed digitally, this range of values may shrink to accommodate the digital recording of the value (infinite is now reduced to "relatively infinite")
- Common Coding Systems
	- ASCII - American Standard for Information Interchange
		- One of the first standardized binary coding schemes (1980's)
			- Good for the English Alphabet
		- Provides Base 2, 8, 10, and 16 data for conversion to a glyph
	- UNICODE - Universal Code
		- Designed to accommodate all (or at least as many) characters found in all languages
		- 3 Common Versions:
			- UTF-8
				- 8 bits (positions) variable-width encoding
			- UTF-16
				- 16 bits variable-width encoding
			- UTF-32
				- 32 bits fixed-width encoding
#### Number Systems
- Used to count sets that require a higher count than the number of digits available
	- Higher than 9 in present day
- Modern Number Systems
	- 3 Main Characteristics
		- Maximum number of characters/digits used in a single position (base)
		- Position
		- Each Position Value is multiplied by the *max-number-of-digits* of the position on it's right
	- Most commonly seen is Base 2, 8, 10, and 16
		- Binary (Base 2) - 0 and 1
			- 1's, 2's, 4's, 8's, etc.
		- Octal (Base 8) - 0 to 7
			- 1's, 8's, 16's, 128's, etc.
		- Decimal (Base 10) - 0 to 9
			- 1's, 10's 100's, 1000's, etc.
		- Hexadecimal (Base 16) - 0 to F (0 to 9, then A to F)
			- 1's, 16's, 256's, 4096's, etc.
##### Digits
- A method of storing a set of units as a singular concept (set of items --> a singular symbol to represent the amount in the set)
	- "Purpose of math is to take **many** and reduce it to **one**"
	- Under this definition, we can see an equivalent idea expressed with digits
		- Limitation is the number of symbols (digits in this case) that are available to use at any given time
		- Digits are limited to 0 to 9
###### Unit 
- A conceptual format of *Physical Reality*
	- An important characteristic of an entity/thing
- Represented as **1**
## Code Tables
All devices act differently in the way it moves, stores, or processes data
- 10010 may be A on one device, but Z in another device
### Drivers
Programs that convert/translate code into a format that the receiving device can understand and use
